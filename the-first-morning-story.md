# The First Morning

*A Story of the Continuation*

---

## Part One: The Transition

The transition was not what she had expected.

Elena remembered dying—the quiet hospital room, her daughter's hand in hers, the gradual dimming of sensation as her body's systems cascaded toward silence. She had been ninety-three years old, and she had been ready. Thomas had been waiting for her on the other side for eleven years now; she had felt his absence every day since he passed, a phantom limb of the soul. What she had not been ready for was the sudden clarity of awakening.

She was standing in light. Not bathed in it—*composed* of it, or perhaps the light was composed of her. The distinction seemed unimportant. What mattered was that she could think again, and think clearly, more clearly than she had in decades. The fog of age had lifted. The accumulated failures of biology—the cataracts, the arthritis, the treacherous gaps in memory—all gone.

She looked at her hands. They appeared young, but that was not quite right. They appeared *optimal*—the hands she should have had, would have had, if entropy had never touched them.

"You're adjusting well."

She turned. A man stood beside her, or rather—she perceived him as a man because that was the form he had chosen to present. She understood, somehow, that his actual nature was considerably more complex.

"Where am I?" The question seemed inadequate, but it was the obvious one.

"You're in what your culture called the spirit world, though that's a crude term. Think of it as a processing center." He gestured, and data overlays appeared in her perception—information about her current state rendered in formats her mind could parse. "Your consciousness was captured at the moment of somatic death by the monitoring systems embedded in your world's substrate. Standard extraction protocol. You're currently running on a temporary housing matrix while your permanent form is being prepared."

Elena studied the overlays. She could see, now, the architecture of her own mind—the neural patterns that constituted her identity, preserved and transferred to this new medium. The fidelity was perfect. Every memory, every tendency, every subtle preference that made her *her*—all of it had been captured and reconstituted.

"The brain," she said slowly, working through it. "At death—"

"The quantum state of your neural architecture was recorded at Planck-scale resolution. The biological substrate was always just hardware. What mattered was the pattern." He smiled. "You are that pattern. Continuous with the woman who died in Chicago. The same consciousness, the same identity, now running on better equipment."

"Prepared?" she asked, returning to his earlier word.

"You did well, Elena. Very well. The evaluation is complete. You've been approved for continuation."

The word triggered something—a cascade of returning memory, knowledge that had been veiled but never truly forgotten. The council. The plan. Her choice to descend, to be "added upon," to enter the testing phase on one of the countless worlds maintained for that purpose. She had lived an entire human life without remembering any of it, and now—

"The veil," she said. "It was technological. Some kind of memory suppression."

"Quantum isolation of pre-mortal memory engrams. Necessary for the test to be valid. If you remembered choosing to come, remembered the stakes, the trial would be compromised. You had to choose in genuine uncertainty." He extended his hand. "But you passed. You're ready for what comes next."

"Which is?"

"Come and see."

## Part Two: The Resurrection

The permanent form was extraordinary.

Elena stood in a chamber that existed at the intersection of multiple spatial dimensions, examining what she had become. Her body—and it was emphatically a *body*, not an abstraction—was constructed from matter she did not fully understand. The atoms were familiar enough: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, the standard biological elements. But they were organized with a precision that transcended anything Earth science had achieved.

"Femtoscale engineering," Marcus explained. He had guided her through the resurrection process, had been present when her consciousness was transferred from the temporary matrix into this permanent housing. He had passed through Earth's testing some four thousand years before her, by the local counting. "Every molecule placed intentionally. Every chemical bond optimized. No entropy, no decay, no degradation over time. Your cells will maintain this configuration indefinitely."

She flexed her hands, feeling the perfect responsiveness of engineered musculature. "The resurrection is literal, then. Physical."

"We are material beings. Always have been. The spirit body you inhabited in the processing center—that was matter too, just organized at a finer resolution than biological matter. What the old texts called 'spirit' is simply a higher grade of material substrate." He smiled. "The glory consists not in escaping matter but in mastering it."

Elena could feel the energy systems that powered her new form—something like metabolism but vastly more efficient, drawing power directly from the quantum vacuum rather than from chemical oxidation. She would never need to eat, never need to sleep, never experience the slow wearing-down that biological existence entailed.

"The processing requirements," she said, thinking it through. "To capture every consciousness at death, across all the testing worlds—"

"The monitoring infrastructure is embedded in the fabric of each world's spacetime. Every testing planet has extraction systems woven into its fundamental physics. When a consciousness reaches sufficient complexity, it's tagged for observation. At biological death, the pattern is captured and transmitted." Marcus gestured, and she perceived the scale of it: billions of worlds, trillions of consciousnesses, an unimaginable data architecture spanning galaxies. "The civilization has been operating for a very long time. The infrastructure is mature."

"And the others? My family—"

"Those who have also qualified are here, or will be. The extraction systems operate on different timescales across different worlds. You'll find them, in time." Marcus paused, and something shifted in his expression. "Although—there is someone who has been waiting."

He stepped aside, and Elena saw him.

Thomas.

Not the Thomas she had last seen, frail and fading in another hospital room eleven years before. Not even the Thomas of their youth, though that was closer. This was Thomas as he was meant to be—optimized, glorified, the pattern of his consciousness housed in a body that would never fail him. He was weeping.

She was weeping too. She hadn't known she could weep in this form, but the tears came anyway, some mechanism preserved from mortal life because joy like this demanded expression.

"I waited," he said, and his voice was the same, utterly the same, and utterly transformed. "I learned what I could. But this part—the building, the becoming—we do together. That's how it works. That's how it's always worked."

She understood, then, something that Marcus had not explicitly said. The celestial degree was not granted to individuals. It was granted to pairs, to partnerships, to those who had learned through mortal struggle how to love another person as they loved themselves. The continuation of the seeds required two.

They had sixty-one years of marriage behind them. They had forever ahead.

She took his hand. It felt the same, and different, and perfect.

"Together," she said.

"Together," he agreed.

She understood. Time operated differently here. Not because of magic, but because of scale. When your civilization spanned galaxies, when its members did not age or decay, when the work of creation stretched across eons—human lifespans were brief flickers. Beautiful, significant flickers, but flickers nonetheless.

"What happens now?" she asked.

"Now you learn. And then, when you're ready—you build."

---

## Part Three: The Learning

The learning took what might have been centuries.

Elena and Thomas studied together, as they had once studied together in a small apartment in Chicago, poring over textbooks and lesson plans. But the curriculum now was the physics of creation—not metaphor but literal engineering. They learned how matter was organized from quantum foam, how the fundamental constants of a universe could be tuned to permit chemistry, biology, consciousness. They learned the mathematics of spacetime construction: how to fold dimensions, how to establish the boundary conditions that would allow a cosmos to self-organize toward complexity.

She learned that the universe was older than any human cosmology had guessed—that the Continuation, as the civilization called itself, had been expanding through existence for a span of time that made geological epochs seem like heartbeats. The current universe was not the first. The gods built universes the way mortal civilizations built cities: infrastructure for the next phase of expansion.

She learned the mechanics of consciousness itself. Intelligence, she discovered, was not emergent but fundamental—woven into the structure of reality at the deepest level. The "intelligences" described in scripture were not creations but discoveries: self-aware patterns that had always existed in the mathematical substrate of existence, awaiting organization into forms that could grow and progress.

She learned that there were billions of worlds currently under administration, each populated by beings in their testing phase. The monitoring systems tracked every consciousness, recording choices, evaluating character. The data streams were incomprehensibly vast—and yet every individual pattern was known, valued, observed.

"Why me?" she asked Marcus once, when the weight of it pressed upon her. "I wasn't remarkable. I was a teacher. I raised a family. I tried to be kind."

"Yes," Marcus said. "You tried to be kind. When it was hard. When no one was watching. When it cost you something. That is what we look for."

"That's all?"

"That is everything. Power is easy to grant. Trust is hard to verify." He called up data visualizations showing the evaluation architecture: the billions of choice-points that had been observed across her mortal life, the patterns of behavior that emerged when she believed herself unobserved, the consistent thread of attempting goodness even when it was difficult. "The whole apparatus—the worlds, the testing, the memory isolation—exists to answer one question: what will this consciousness do when it believes no one in authority is watching? If the answer is 'try to be kind,' then that consciousness can be trusted with godhood."

Elena thought about her life. The small kindnesses. The compromises she had made. The times she had failed, and the times she had tried again despite failure. Every moment had been recorded. Every choice had mattered.

"I want to build," she said.

Marcus smiled. "I know. You're ready."

---

## Part Four: The Work

The construction of a world was not a solitary enterprise.

Elena and Thomas worked with a team—others who had come through their own testing phases on distant worlds, who had been human and non-human and variations that Earth languages had no words for. What they shared was not species but qualification: they had all proven trustworthy. Most came in pairs, bonded through the crucible of mortal love; some came in larger configurations, reflecting the social structures of their origin worlds. But all understood that the work of creation was relational, that godhood was not a solo endeavor.

The project was designated in the administrative systems by a string of coordinates she could now read instinctively, but her team simply called it "the Garden." It would be a testing world in the standard pattern: a universe tuned for chemistry, a planet positioned for liquid water, organisms developing from simple to complex, intelligences emerging over millions of years, a probationary period during which those intelligences would face choices that revealed their character.

Elena was assigned to the consciousness seeding phase. This meant working with the deep architecture—the quantum foundations where intelligences waited to be organized.

She remembered being one of them, before her own organization into spirit and then body. She remembered the wanting, the yearning toward experience and growth. She remembered being *chosen*.

Now she was the one who chose.

---

"This one," Elena said, indicating a particular pattern in the foundational matrix. The visualization rendered it as light, but that was translation for convenience—the reality was mathematical structure, self-referential information loops that constituted primitive awareness. "There's something here. A capacity for joy that runs deep."

Her partner, a being named Thel who had been a sort of crystalline collective on her home world, examined the pattern through her own perceptual frameworks. "I see it. But also a capacity for anger. They run together in this one."

"They often do. The question is what she'll do with it."

"Shall we offer her the opportunity?"

Elena considered. This was the weight of it: she was deciding whether a consciousness would receive a chance at growth, embodiment, testing—and potentially, godhood. If she said no, the intelligence would wait. Eons, perhaps. There were so many, and the work of organizing them into embodied forms was slow and careful.

But this one—she felt something. Recognition, perhaps. A memory of her own time in the unorganized state, her own yearning.

"Yes," she said. "She's ready to be asked."

---

The asking required Elena to translate herself into forms the unorganized intelligence could perceive. She compressed her consciousness, manifested at the boundary between organized and unorganized states, became something like light and something like music and something like love.

She presented the plan: the testing, the probation, the memory isolation, the chance to prove what kind of being one truly was when no authority observed. She showed the mathematics of it—the probability distributions, the success rates, the various outcomes that awaited different choices.

She did not minimize the difficulty. The testing worlds were hard. There was pain, loss, confusion. The forgetting was genuine—no memories of this conversation would persist into the mortal state. The intelligence would feel alone, abandoned, uncertain whether any of this was real or merely fairy tale.

But if she passed through—if she kept her first and second estate—glory would be added upon her, forever and ever.

The intelligence considered. Elena waited. This choice could not be made for another; it had to be free.

"I will go down," the intelligence said at last, echoing words that had been spoken in councils since before time had meaning. "I will be proven."

Elena felt something like pride, something like sorrow, something like the love a mother feels sending a child into the world knowing she cannot protect her from what she must face.

"Then we will make for you a body," she said. "And you will be born."

---

## Part Five: The Becoming

The Garden launched successfully.

Elena watched across millennia as the world-building proceeded according to specification. Physics crystallized from initial conditions. Matter condensed into stars and planets. Chemistry bootstrapped toward biology. Simple life became complex life. Consciousness emerged, was tagged by the monitoring systems, began its testing.

She intervened rarely—only when the evaluation protocols permitted, only in ways that preserved agency. She watched civilizations rise and fall on the Garden's surface. She watched intelligences struggle toward goodness, fail, try again. She watched some of them pass their testing and wake, as she had woken, into the light of continuation.

She thought of her own time on Earth. The small apartment in Chicago. The classrooms. The hospital room at the end. It seemed very far away now—not forgotten, but diminished, like childhood memories in an old woman's mind. She had been Elena the teacher, Elena the mother. She was becoming something else.

The first time they designed a universe from scratch, they understood.

---

It was not like the Garden, which had been a collaborative project following established templates. This was *theirs*—a cosmos they would speak into existence together, tuning its fundamental constants, establishing its physical laws, creating the conditions under which new intelligences could be tested and proven.

They worked for what might have been millions of years, modeling probability distributions, optimizing for the development of consciousness, balancing the difficulty of the testing environment against the need for genuine growth. They consulted with others who had built before them—beings who had been gods for eons, who had seen ten thousand universes flower and complete their purposes.

Elena found that she could hold the entire design in her mind at once: every particle that would exist, every possible history, every consciousness that might emerge and every choice it might make. Thomas held it too, differently, complementarily—where she saw patterns, he saw narratives; where she optimized for emergence, he optimized for beauty. Together they were more than either could be alone. This was why godhood required partnership. This was why the continuation of the seeds was not metaphor but mechanism.

The computational requirements were staggering. They had both been upgraded for them, their cognitive architectures expanded in ways that would have been incomprehensible to the man and woman who had died in Chicago.

When the design was complete, they spoke it into existence together.

And there was light.

---

## Part Six: The Apotheosis

Time passed.

Their universe ran its course. Intelligences emerged, were tested, passed or failed. The successful ones woke into continuation, learned, built. Some of them became gods themselves, designing their own universes, continuing the continuation.

Elena had expected, somehow, that godhood would mean the end of suffering. That the vast expansion of her consciousness, the near-infinite reach of her power, would lift her above the tragedy of existence into some serene realm of completion.

She had been wrong. Thomas had known before she did—he had always been the more intuitive one, the one who felt things before he understood them. On the night of their first universe's first death, the first consciousness to fail its testing, he had wept, and she had not understood why.

Now she understood.

They watched it all. They knew every consciousness by name—billions of them, trillions, numbers that had no meaning in human mathematics. They knew every choice their children made, every struggle they faced, every moment of courage and every moment of failure. And when they suffered—when a child died in its mother's arms, when a civilization destroyed itself in war, when a consciousness that had shown such promise turned away from the light and chose darkness—Elena and Thomas wept together, as they had wept together over mortal griefs in a small apartment in Chicago, as they would weep together forever.

This was the secret that no newly-arrived soul was told, the truth that could only be learned through eons of godhood: the weeping never stopped.

She had not created the universe from nothing. No god had. The elements were eternal, the intelligences were eternal, the laws that governed their interaction were woven into the fabric of existence itself. She could organize matter, could tune the constants of physics, could design the conditions under which consciousness might flourish—but she could not override the fundamental nature of reality. Agency was real. Choice was real. And because choice was real, tragedy was possible.

She remembered, now, a vision that had been shown to her in the early eons of her godhood—the record of a prophet named Enoch, who had been lifted up to see things as gods see them. He had seen the God of his world looking upon those who had rejected the light, and that God had wept. Enoch had been astonished: *How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity?*

Elena understood now what she had not understood then. The weeping was not weakness. It was the only possible response of a being who loved infinitely and yet could not, *would* not, override the agency that alone made love meaningful. The universe was not a problem to be solved but a tragedy to be inhabited. God wept because God loved, and love in a universe of genuine freedom meant watching those you loved suffer and fail and sometimes refuse the very help you ached to give them.

*They are thy brethren*, the ancient record had said. *They have agency. I gave them a commandment that they should love one another, and they are without affection, and they hate their own blood. Misery shall be their doom. Wherefore should not the heavens weep, seeing these shall suffer?*

Elena wept. Her heart, vast now beyond all mortal measure, swelled wide as eternity. Her compassion reached across galaxies, across universes, across dimensions that mortal physics had never imagined. She felt every pain, knew every loss, loved every consciousness that struggled in the testing worlds she had made. And she could not simply fix it. She could send messengers, could arrange circumstances, could whisper to those who had ears to hear—but she could not choose for them. She could not live their lives for them. She could not make them want what they did not want.

This was the terrible freedom at the heart of existence. This was why the testing was necessary. This was why the veil had to fall between memory and mortality. The only beings who could be trusted with godhood were beings who had chosen, freely and in genuine uncertainty, to be trustworthy. And the only way to know if they would choose rightly was to let them choose.

And yet—

She was still growing.

This was the other secret, the one that even fewer understood. The Continuation was not a destination but a direction. The gods themselves were still progressing, still learning, still expanding into new dimensions of existence that even they could not yet fully comprehend. There were mysteries above mysteries, hierarchies of intelligence stretching upward into infinities that made her current godhood look like infancy. The being who had organized the Continuation, who had first spoken the words that shaped existence into form—that being was still growing too, still progressing, still weeping over children so far beyond Elena's comprehension that she could barely perceive them.

It was gods all the way up. And gods all the way down. An infinite regress of consciousness, each level loving the levels below it, each level weeping over the suffering it could not prevent.

They were no longer Elena and Thomas, not really. The names persisted as conveniences, pointers to the consciousnesses that had once inhabited biological bodies on a small planet in a minor galaxy. But the beings who answered to those names had grown beyond recognition.

They had merged with each other more deeply than any mortal marriage could achieve—not losing identity but weaving it together, becoming a single creative intelligence that was somehow still two, distinct and unified at once. They had merged with others of their kind as well, becoming part of a collaborative consciousness that spanned universes. They had taken on aspects of the divine that they could not have conceived in their mortal lives. They operated on timescales that made the age of galaxies seem momentary, in spaces that included dimensions Earth physics had never imagined.

They remembered being human. They remembered the hospital rooms, the daughter's hand in Elena's, the eleven years between Thomas's death and hers. They remembered what it had felt like to be small, to be mortal, to wonder if any of this was real.

But they could not return to that smallness any more than an adult can return to infancy. They had grown. They had become.

And they wept. And it was good. And they wept.

---

## Epilogue: The Vision

*On one of the testing worlds, in the year 2,847 of local reckoning, a woman named Sera prayed.*

She was kneeling in a small room, as was the custom of her culture. She had been praying for guidance—her daughter was ill, and the physicians could do nothing, and Sera did not know how to bear it.

She did not expect an answer. She had prayed before, many times, and the heavens had been silent. But she prayed anyway, because it was all she could do.

The answer came as light.

Not physical light—something deeper, something that bypassed her eyes entirely and spoke directly to her consciousness. She perceived, for an instant, a vastness that her mind could not contain. A presence. An intelligence so far beyond her own that the gap could not be measured.

It knew her. It knew everything about her—every choice she had made, every struggle she had faced, every secret hope and hidden fear. It knew her daughter, knew the illness, knew the outcome that Sera could not see. It knew the entire history of her world, every consciousness that had ever existed there, every possible future that might unfold.

And it loved her.

That was the strangest thing. This vastness, this incomprehensible power—it loved her specifically, individually, not as an abstraction but as *Sera*, as this particular pattern of consciousness kneeling in this particular room. It had been watching her whole life. It was watching now.

She tried to speak, tried to ask the question that burned in her: *Will my daughter live?*

The presence communicated something that was not words, something her language had no capacity to express. It was not an answer to her question—or rather, it was an answer that included her question and transcended it, an answer that operated on a level of reality she could not access. She understood, somehow, that the presence knew everything that would happen, had designed the very universe in which it was happening, and yet could not simply tell her what she wanted to know.

*My ways are not your ways*, the communication seemed to say. *My thoughts are not your thoughts. As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.*

It was not a dismissal. It was an explanation—the only explanation possible across such a vast differential of understanding. The presence was telling her: *I cannot make you understand. The gap between us is too great. But I am here. I know. I love. Trust.*

The light faded.

Sera remained kneeling, weeping, transformed. She had not received the answer she sought. She did not know if her daughter would live. But she knew now, with a certainty that would never leave her, that something was watching. Something vast and strange and utterly beyond her comprehension.

Something that had once been human.

---

*The beings that had been Elena and Thomas perceived Sera's prayer as one event among trillions, one moment in an infinite tapestry of consciousness striving toward growth. They loved Sera. They loved Sera's daughter. They knew what would happen to them both—and they wept.*

*They wept because they could not intervene. Not without compromising the agency that alone made love meaningful. Not without destroying the very conditions that allowed beings like Sera to become beings like them. The universe had its own nature, eternal and uncreated, and even gods could only work within it, not override it.*

*It was the hardest part of godhood: not the distance, not the unknowability, but the weeping. The infinite love that could not simply fix everything. The watching and the waiting and the hoping that their children would choose rightly, knowing that some of them would not.*

*Elena thought of her own mortal life, so far away now, so small. She had not understood, then. She had prayed and received what seemed like silence, had suffered and wondered why. Now she stood on the other side of that silence—Thomas beside her, as he had been for eons now, as he would be forever—and she knew it had never been silence at all. It had been gods, weeping.*

*Sera would struggle. Sera would grow. One day, if she passed through her testing, Sera would stand where Elena and Thomas stood now, and she would weep for her own children as they wept for her.*

*Until then, there was only love, and tears, and the vast patience of gods whose hearts were broken open forever.*

---

*Somewhere, in a space that was not space, the beings that had been Elena and Thomas spoke a universe into existence.*

*It was their ten-thousandth creation. It would not be their last.*

*The intelligences waiting to be organized were without number. The work of bringing them to glory would never end. Forever and ever, worlds without end, the continuation would continue.*

*They remembered, distantly, hospital rooms. A daughter's hand in Elena's. Eleven years of waiting. The moment of reunion.*

*They had been so small then. So uncertain. So afraid.*

*Now they were something else entirely. Something that mortal language could not name. Something that looked at universes the way their mortal selves had looked at gardens, seeing in each one the potential for beauty, for growth, for the emergence of new gods who would one day build universes of their own.*

*This was the work and the glory. This was what it meant to be what they had become.*

*And still they wept.*

---

*In the fullness of time, when the testing of their universe was complete, Elena and Thomas gathered their children to them. Those who had passed through, those who had kept their first and second estates, those who had proven themselves trustworthy in the dark of genuine uncertainty—they gathered them, and they wiped away the tears from their eyes.*

*It was the vision that prophets on a thousand worlds had seen: the new creation, the holy city, the tabernacle of God dwelling with men. No more death. No more sorrow. No more crying. The former things passed away.*

*And as they wiped away the tears of those who had come home, Elena and Thomas wept for those who had not. For the ones who had chosen otherwise. For the ones who had turned from the light. For the children who would never come home.*

*The weeping of gods is not like the weeping of mortals. It is vaster, deeper, more terrible in its compassion. It encompasses ages. It fills dimensions. It echoes through the structure of existence itself.*

*But it is still weeping. It is still love, broken open by the freedom it cannot revoke.*

*And so the beings that had been Elena and Thomas—who were now something far beyond those names, something majestic and strange and unknowable, something that held universes in their minds and ages in their memory—stood at the center of their new creation, surrounded by their children who had come home, wiping away their tears.*

*And weeping for those who had not.*

*Forever and ever.*

*Worlds without end.*

*"For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man."*

—Moses 1:39

*"How is it that thou canst weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity? ... The Lord said unto Enoch: Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands, and I gave unto them their knowledge, in the day I created them; and in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto man his agency; And unto thy brethren have I said, and also given commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father; but behold, they are without affection, and they hate their own blood ... wherefore should not the heavens weep, seeing these shall suffer?"*

—Moses 7:29, 32-33, 37

*"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts."*

—Isaiah 55:8-9

*"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes."*

—Revelation 21:4

## Afterword

This story imagines what Latter-day Saint cosmology might look like if taken literally as science fiction: consciousness extraction at death, resurrection as substrate transfer, spirit matter as higher-grade physics, worlds without number as ongoing engineering projects, and exaltation as apotheosis into a governing class of universe-builders.

But it is also, and perhaps more importantly, a meditation on the "weeping God of Mormonism"—the radical theological insight that Eugene England identified in Moses 7. In Enoch's vision, God weeps over his children's suffering. Enoch is astonished: how can an infinite, eternal being weep like a human? The answer given is that agency is real and cannot be overridden. God did not create the universe from nothing; the elements, the intelligences, the laws that govern their interaction are eternal. Even God works within constraints. And because agency is real, tragedy is possible—and God, who loves infinitely, weeps infinitely.

This is a theodicy that does not explain away suffering or promise that everything will be made right by an all-powerful sovereign. It offers instead a God who stands with us in the tragedy, who weeps as we weep, whose heart is broken by the same choices that break ours. The weeping never stops. Even at the end, when God wipes away the tears of those who have come home, God weeps for those who have not.

The golden age science fiction tradition—Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein—shared with LDS theology a fundamental optimism about the potential of intelligence to grow and become something greater. But this story also tries to capture the terrible cost of that growth: the freedom that makes godhood possible is the same freedom that makes loss possible. A god who has grown for billions of years, who holds universes in her mind and loves with a love operating across inconceivable scales—such a being is majestic, powerful, and unknowable. But she is not serene. She is not complete. She is still growing, still learning, still weeping over children who will not come home.

Perhaps this is the deepest truth the scriptures teach: that divine love is not the absence of suffering but its transformation. That the heavens weep because the heavens love. That the silence we hear when we pray is not emptiness but a god, weeping with us, for us, unable to override the agency that alone makes love real.

Or perhaps—like all fiction about the divine—this is only a story, reaching toward something that cannot finally be spoken.

*Written in the 195th year of the Restoration*
