# The Paradox of the Narrow Way: God's Universal Salvation and His Small Covenant People

One of the most striking tensions in scripture is the apparent contradiction between God's universal desire to save all His children and the persistent reality that "few there be that find" the path to eternal life. If God truly wants to save everyone, why does He work through a small covenant people? Why has the church always been a minority? The prophets address this directly, and their answers reveal not a failure of God's plan but its deliberate design.

## God's Universal Intent

The scriptures leave no ambiguity about the scope of God's saving work. Paul declared that "the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men" ([Titus 2:11](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/Titus%202.11.md)). John's Revelation extends the invitation to "whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely" ([Revelation 22:17](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/Revelation%2022.17.md)). The resurrected Christ Himself called out to "the ends of the earth" to repent and be saved ([3 Nephi 9:22](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/3%20Nephi%209.22.md)).

This is not the language of selectivity. Moses recorded that "this is the plan of salvation unto all men" ([Moses 6:62](standard-works-vault/Pearl%20of%20Great%20Price/Moses%206.62.md)). Peter taught that the gospel was "preached also to them that are dead" ([1 Peter 4:6](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/1%20Peter%204.6.md))—extending God's reach beyond the boundaries of mortality itself. The divine intent is unmistakable: every nation, all flesh, whosoever will.

## The Narrow Reality

Yet Christ Himself acknowledged the tension. In the Sermon on the Mount, He warned: "Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it" ([Matthew 7:14](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/Matthew%207.14.md)). Nephi saw the same vision, describing "the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate" ([2 Nephi 31:9](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/2%20Nephi%2031.9.md)).

How do we reconcile these truths? God offers salvation to all, yet few accept. The gate stands open, but most walk past.

## Why So Few: The Prophetic Diagnosis

The prophets do not leave us wondering. They identify the barriers with uncomfortable clarity.

**Pride** stands as the primary obstacle. The Psalmist observed that "the wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God" ([Psalm 10:4](standard-works-vault/Old%20Testament/Psalms%2010.4.md)). Nephi saw our day and warned of "the wise, and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed up in the pride of their hearts" ([2 Nephi 28:15](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/2%20Nephi%2028.15.md)). Jacob's brother offered the diagnosis that echoes through the centuries: "When they are learned they think they are wise" ([2 Nephi 9:28](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/2%20Nephi%209.28.md)).

**Hardness of heart** compounds the problem. Mark records that Jesus was "grieved for the hardness of their hearts" ([Mark 3:5](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/Mark%203.5.md)). Paul explained the mechanism: hearts become "hardened through the deceitfulness of sin" ([Hebrews 3:13](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/Hebrews%203.13.md)). Alma taught the consequence: "He that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion" ([Alma 12:10](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Alma%2012.10.md)). The hardening is not imposed by God but chosen by men.

**Worldliness** completes the triad. Samuel the Lamanite indicted his generation with words that could have been written yesterday: "Ye do not remember the Lord your God in the things with which he hath blessed you, but ye do always remember your riches" ([Helaman 13:22](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Helaman%2013.22.md)). Prosperity becomes a snare when it turns hearts from the Giver to the gifts.

The pattern is consistent across dispensations: God extends the invitation universally, but people voluntarily reject it through pride, hard hearts, and distraction. The narrowness of the way is not God's restriction but humanity's self-selection.

## The Strategy of the Remnant

This brings us to the deeper question: why does God work through a small covenant people at all? If He desires to save everyone, why not do so directly?

The scriptures reveal that Israel was never chosen for exclusivity but for distribution. The Abrahamic covenant makes this explicit: "In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed" ([Genesis 12:3](standard-works-vault/Old%20Testament/Genesis%2012.3.md)). Isaiah declared God's purpose for His servant Israel: "I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles" ([Isaiah 49:6](standard-works-vault/Old%20Testament/Isaiah%2049.6.md)). Modern revelation confirms the pattern: covenant holders are to be "a light unto the Gentiles, and through this priesthood, a savior unto my people Israel" ([D&C 86:11](standard-works-vault/Doctrine%20and%20Covenants/D&C%2086.11.md)).

The covenant people function as instruments, not endpoints. They are the salt of the earth ([D&C 101:39](standard-works-vault/Doctrine%20and%20Covenants/D&C%20101.39.md)), the light on a hill ([D&C 115:5](standard-works-vault/Doctrine%20and%20Covenants/D&C%20115.5.md)), the witnesses to all nations ([Isaiah 43:10](standard-works-vault/Old%20Testament/Isaiah%2043.10.md)). The imagery throughout scripture—mustard seed, leaven, olive branches—emphasizes something small that permeates and transforms the whole.

Isaiah captured this in stark terms: "Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant" ([Isaiah 1:9](standard-works-vault/Old%20Testament/Isaiah%201.9.md)). The smallness is not failure but design. A faithful remnant can be tested thoroughly, demonstrate God's power through apparent weakness, preserve doctrinal purity amid apostasy, and expand influence like leaven working through dough.

## The Church as Gathering Mechanism

The Lord defined His church simply: "Whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me, the same is my church" ([D&C 10:67](standard-works-vault/Doctrine%20and%20Covenants/D&C%2010.67.md)). The church exists not as a club for the saved but as a net for gathering. Its commission is clear: "Ye are called to bring to pass the gathering of mine elect; for mine elect hear my voice and harden not their hearts" ([D&C 29:7](standard-works-vault/Doctrine%20and%20Covenants/D&C%2029.7.md)).

The elect are identified not by predetermined selection but by response—those who "hear my voice" from among all nations and peoples. The gathering happens "one by one" ([Isaiah 27:12](standard-works-vault/Old%20Testament/Isaiah%2027.12.md)), individual by individual, as each person chooses to soften their heart and enter the covenant.

Nephi saw the end of this process: "He gathereth his children from the four quarters of the earth... there shall be one fold and one shepherd" ([1 Nephi 22:25](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/1%20Nephi%2022.25.md)). The scattered become gathered. The few become many. The remnant becomes a multitude.

## The Resolution: God's Timetable

The apparent tension resolves when we see that God's timetable extends beyond mortality. The Lord declared through the Nephite record: "I have covenanted with them that I would gather them together in mine own due time" ([3 Nephi 20:29](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/3%20Nephi%2020.29.md)).

"In mine own due time." The gathering happens on God's schedule, not ours. The gospel reaches the dead. Temple ordinances extend to all who have ever lived. The work continues on both sides of the veil until every child of God has received a fair opportunity to accept or reject the covenant.

The church being small in mortality does not limit God's final harvest. The current state is not the end state. What we see now is the seed planted, the leaven working, the net cast. The parable of the wheat and tares reminds us that the full separation and gathering comes at harvest time, not during the growing season.

## Conclusion

The paradox of the narrow way is not a contradiction but a revelation of divine method. God desires to save all and has provided means for all to be saved—including those who never heard the gospel in mortality. Yet He honors agency absolutely, allowing pride, hard hearts, and worldliness to keep many from the path that stands open before them.

The covenant people are not God's favorites but His instruments. Their calling is not privilege but responsibility: to be the salt, the light, the witnesses through whom all families of the earth may be blessed. The church's small size is not evidence of failure but of faithful gathering, one by one, of those who hear the voice and soften their hearts.

In the end, every knee shall bow and every tongue confess. The question is not whether God will offer salvation to all—He already has, He does now, and He will continue until the work is complete. The question is whether we, individually, will harden our hearts or hear His voice.

The gate is strait. The way is narrow. Few there be that find it.

But the gate stands open. And the invitation extends to whosoever will.
