# "Let God Prevail" — Scripture Study Mashup

**Based on President Russell M. Nelson's October 2020 General Conference address**

The central revelation of this talk is deceptively simple: the Hebrew word *Israel* can mean "let God prevail." From that single etymological insight, President Nelson unfolds a theology of willingness — that the defining mark of covenant identity is not lineage, geography, or ritual, but the choice to let God be the most powerful influence in your life.

What follows is a thematic scripture study built around the talk's major threads.

---

## 1. The Name and the Wrestle: What "Israel" Means

At Peniel, Jacob wrestled through the night and refused to let go until he received a blessing. God changed his name:

"And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed." ([Genesis 32:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/32.28))

The Bible Dictionary footnote is key: *Israel* "may also mean, Let God prevail." The name isn't a boast about Jacob overpowering God — it's a declaration of surrender. Jacob proved what mattered most to him, and God gave him a name that encoded that choice forever.

The promises that followed were staggering:

"And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land." ([Genesis 35:11-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/35.11))

**Study question:** Jacob's wrestle was physical and exhausting. What is your Peniel — the place where you wrestle with God not to defeat Him but to prove you won't let go of Him?

## 2. "He Loveth Those Who Will Have Him to Be Their God"

President Nelson quoted this verse from Nephi as the Lord's own summary of how He feels about people who let God prevail:

"And he loveth those who will have him to be their God. Behold, he loved our fathers, and he covenanted with them, yea, even Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and he remembered the covenants which he had made; wherefore, he did bring them out of the land of Egypt." ([1 Nephi 17:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.40))

Notice the logic: God's love leads to covenants, covenants lead to deliverance. The verb *loveth* is present tense — it's not only about ancient patriarchs. It's about anyone, now, who will have Him as their God.

Compare Joshua's challenge to Israel on the same theme:

"Choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." ([Joshua 24:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/24.15))

---

## 3. The Will Swallowed Up: Christ as the Perfect "Israel"

If *Israel* means "let God prevail," then Jesus Christ is the ultimate Israelite — the one whose will was perfectly swallowed up in the Father's:

"Yea, even so he shall be led, crucified, and slain, the flesh becoming subject even unto death, the will of the Son being swallowed up in the will of the Father." ([Mosiah 15:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.7))

"For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me." ([John 6:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/6.38))

And at the moment of His greatest agony, the same yielding:

"Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done." ([Luke 22:42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/22.42))

President Nelson asked: "Are you willing to have your will swallowed up in His?" The Savior showed what that looks like — not passive resignation but active, agonizing submission. It cost Him everything. The phrase "swallowed up" in Mosiah 15:7 isn't gentle. It suggests complete absorption, total surrender of self-direction.

The Kirtland Temple dedication prayer echoes this posture:

"Help thy servants to say, with thy grace assisting them: Thy will be done, O Lord, and not ours." ([D&C 109:44](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109.44))

**Study question:** Where in your life are you still negotiating with God rather than letting His will swallow yours?

## 4. Putting Off the Natural Man — The Cost of Willingness

Letting God prevail is not a single decision but a sustained transformation. King Benjamin's angel gave the clearest description of what it requires:

"For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father." ([Mosiah 3:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.19))

That final clause — "willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him" — is the Mosiah 3:19 version of "let God prevail." It includes not just obeying commandments but accepting outcomes you didn't choose.

This is exactly where the talk's story of "Jill" lives. Her father was dying. She wanted a miracle. Instead she got a single word: *myopic.* She had to let God prevail over her own timeline, her own definition of a good outcome. The verse that speaks to that kind of faith:

"Ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith." ([Ether 12:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.6))

## 5. Overcoming Myopia: The Eternal Perspective

President Nelson's one-word answer — *myopic* — is a rebuke of spiritual nearsightedness. The scriptures consistently call us to see beyond the immediate:

"For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory; while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal." ([2 Corinthians 4:17-18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/4.17))

"For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts." ([Isaiah 55:8-9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/55.8))

"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding." ([Proverbs 3:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/3.5))

And the why behind it all:

"Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy." ([2 Nephi 2:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.25))

The plan of happiness ([Alma 42:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42.8)) is the corrective lens for spiritual myopia. When we see mortal life as a brief episode within an eternal arc, even the death of a loved one can be held — not dismissed, but held — inside a larger hope.

**Study question:** What situation in your life right now looks devastating up close but might look different from an eternal vantage point?

## 6. All Are Alike Unto God: The Universal Reach of the Covenant

One of the most striking moments in the talk was President Nelson's direct call to abandon racism and prejudice. The doctrinal foundation:

"He inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile." ([2 Nephi 26:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33))

Paul made the same argument:

"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus." ([Galatians 3:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/gal/3.28))

And the covenant mechanism for inclusion is adoption, not bloodline:

"As many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father." ([Abraham 2:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/2.10))

"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together." ([Romans 8:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8.17))

If *Israel* means "let God prevail," then anyone — regardless of race, nation, or background — who makes that choice becomes Israel. The gathering net is expansive precisely because the qualifying criterion is internal, not external.

---

## 7. The Gathering: Scattering, Mercy, and Regathering

The talk frames the modern gathering of Israel as the preeminent work of the last days. The prophetic scaffolding:

**The scattering** happened because Israel broke their covenants and stoned the prophets.

**The promise to regather:**

"For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee." ([Isaiah 54:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/54.7))

"And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people … and he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth." ([Isaiah 11:11-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/11.11))

The Book of Mormon confirms this is happening now:

"And it shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, unto the making known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed." ([1 Nephi 22:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22.9))

"And it shall come to pass that my people, which are of the house of Israel, shall be gathered home unto the lands of their possessions; and my word also shall be gathered in one. And I will show unto them that fight against my word and against my people, who are of the house of Israel, that I am God, and that I covenanted with Abraham that I would remember his seed forever." ([2 Nephi 29:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.14))

With President Nelson's insight, these prophecies gain a new dimension: the gathering is not merely geographical or ecclesiastical. It is gathering people *who are willing to let God prevail*. Every missionary discussion, every temple ordinance, every act of covenant-keeping is an act of gathering.

## 8. Perilous Times and Spiritual Survival

President Nelson warned that "Satan is no longer even trying to hide his attacks on God's plan." Paul saw this coming:

"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy … lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof." ([2 Timothy 3:1-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-tim/3.1))

The antidote Nelson offers is not retreat but resolve: "The only way to survive spiritually is to be determined to let God prevail in our lives." The scriptures echo:

"Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest." ([Joshua 1:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/1.9))

"Stand ye in holy places, and be not moved, until the day of the Lord come; for behold, it cometh quickly, saith the Lord." ([D&C 87:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87.8))

---

## 9. God Fights Our Battles — The Covenant Promise

President Nelson closed with the Lord's pledge to covenant Israel:

"And I, the Lord, would fight their battles, and their children's battles, and their children's children's, until they had avenged themselves on all their enemies, to the third and fourth generation." ([D&C 98:37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98.37))

"For I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children." ([Isaiah 49:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/49.25))

"I do not require at their hands to fight the battles of Zion; for, as I said in a former commandment, even so will I fulfil — I will fight your battles." ([D&C 105:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.14))

"O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord preserveth the faithful." ([Psalm 31:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/31.23))

This is the covenant payoff. Those who let God prevail don't just endure — they are fought for, preserved, and ultimately made into something luminous:

"And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him." ([Malachi 3:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3.17))

---

## 10. A God of Miracles

The talk's final testimony:

"As you choose to let God prevail in your lives, you will experience for yourselves that our God is 'a God of miracles.'"

"But behold, I will show unto you a God of miracles, even the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and it is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are." ([Mormon 9:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.11))

"It is by faith that miracles are wrought." ([Moroni 7:37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.37))

The miracles aren't necessarily the kind Jill wanted for her father — a medical reversal, a last-minute reprieve. The miracle is transformation: a person wrecked by grief finds peace. A word like *myopic* becomes a lifeline. A broken heart is healed not by getting what it wants but by being expanded to want what God wants.

That is the miracle of letting God prevail.
