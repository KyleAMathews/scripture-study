# A Theory of Teaching Doctrine: Research Notes

## The Central Thesis

Teaching doctrine is not primarily about information transfer. It is about creating the conditions under which the Holy Ghost can work a transformation in the learner's heart. The goal is not that people *know* doctrine, but that they *live* doctrine—and through living it, are converted and changed.

As the Come, Follow Me introduction states: "The aim of all gospel learning and teaching is to deepen our conversion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ."

This has radical implications for how we teach.

## Part 1: The Scriptural Foundation

### The Triad of Teaching Power (Alma 17:2-3)

The sons of Mosiah provide the definitive scriptural model for powerful doctrinal teaching:

> "They were men of a sound understanding and they had **searched the scriptures diligently**, that they might know the word of God. But this is not all; they had given themselves to **much prayer, and fasting**; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they **taught with power and authority of God**."

Three elements, each necessary, none sufficient alone:
1. **Diligent scripture study** → "sound understanding" and "knowledge of the word of God"
2. **Prayer and fasting** → "spirit of prophecy" and "spirit of revelation"
3. **Result** → Teaching "with power and authority of God"

This is the formula. There are no shortcuts.

### The Spirit as the Real Teacher (2 Nephi 33:1)

> "When a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost **carrieth it unto the hearts** of the children of men."

Note the mechanism: The Holy Ghost does not merely *confirm* truth after we speak it. The Spirit *carries* truth into hearts. The teacher is the instrument; the Holy Ghost is the active agent of transformation.

### The Divine Mandate (D&C 42:14)

> "If ye receive not the Spirit ye shall not teach."

This is not a suggestion. It is a prohibition. Teaching without the Spirit is not merely less effective—it is not authorized. The Lord forbids it.

### The Test of True Teaching (D&C 50:17-22)

The Lord asks a diagnostic question: "He that is ordained of me and sent forth to preach the word of truth by the Comforter, in the Spirit of truth, doth he preach it by the Spirit of truth or some other way?"

Then He provides the test: "Wherefore, he that preacheth and he that receiveth, understand one another, and **both are edified and rejoice together**."

When teaching is of God:
- Mutual understanding occurs
- Both teacher and learner are edified
- Both experience joy

If these are absent, the teaching—however accurate the content—was "some other way."

### The Boundaries of Doctrine (3 Nephi 11:39-40)

> "This is my doctrine, and whoso buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them. And whoso shall declare **more or less than this**, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil."

Doctrine has boundaries. Adding to it or subtracting from it is not teaching doctrine—it is teaching something else. This requires teachers to know what the doctrine actually *is*, which requires deep familiarity with scripture and prophetic teaching.

## Part 2: The Nature of Doctrine

### What Is "The Doctrine of Christ"?

Elder Brian K. Ashton (October 2016) defines it precisely:

> "The scriptures define the doctrine of Christ as exercising faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repenting, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end."

This is not a list of topics. It is a process—a cycle that produces transformation:

1. **Faith in Christ** → We hear the word of Christ and choose to follow Him, relying wholly on His merits
2. **Repentance** → We change thoughts, actions, and being to become more like the Savior
3. **Baptism/Sacrament** → We enter covenant relationship and renew those covenants
4. **Gift of the Holy Ghost** → We receive sanctifying power and constant companionship of a member of the Godhead
5. **Enduring to the end** → We repeat the cycle, iteratively, throughout life

### Doctrine as Power, Not Just Information

Elder Ashton again: "The doctrine of Christ allows us to access the spiritual power that will lift us from our current spiritual state to a state where we can become perfected."

Paul taught the same: the gospel comes "in word and in power" (1 Thessalonians 1:5). David M. McConkie emphasized: "The word of the gospel is written in the scriptures, and we can obtain the word by diligently searching. The power of the gospel comes into the lives of those who so live that the Holy Ghost is their companion."

A teacher can have the word without the power. That teacher can transfer information but cannot facilitate transformation.

### The Virtuous Cycle

Elder Dale G. Renlund (April 2024) describes how the doctrine of Christ creates "spiritual momentum":

> "The elements of the doctrine of Christ—such as faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, entering a covenant relationship with the Lord through baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end—are not intended to be experienced as one-time, check-the-box events."

Two key words: **repeatedly** and **iteratively**.

- *Repeatedly* means we experience the elements over and over
- *Iteratively* means we build and improve with each repetition

"Even though we repeat the elements, we are not just spinning in circles without a forward trajectory. Instead, we draw closer to Jesus Christ each time through the cycle."

The kayak metaphor: momentum protects us. When we stop paddling, we become vulnerable to waves. Consistent forward motion toward Christ provides stability.

## Part 3: How the Spirit Teaches (And How We Should Mirror It)

### Teaching "After the Manner of the Spirit" (Moroni 6:9)

Elder Matthew O. Richardson (October 2011) draws out the implications:

> "To conduct ourselves 'after the manner' of the Holy Ghost means that we may need to change our way of teaching to emulate the way the Holy Ghost teaches. As we align our manner with the Holy Ghost's manner, then the Holy Ghost can teach and testify without restraint."

Two fundamental workings of the Spirit we must emulate:

**1. The Holy Ghost teaches individuals personally**

The Spirit teaches what each person "must know and do so we may become what we must be." Teaching is not broadcasting; it is ministering.

Implication: "Those who teach after the manner of the Spirit understand they teach people, not lessons. As such, they overcome the urge to cover everything in a manual or teach all they have learned on the subject and focus instead on those things that their family or class members need to know and do."

This requires teachers to "pause to listen, carefully observe, and then discern what to do next."

**2. The Holy Ghost invites agency, never overrides it**

> "The Holy Ghost cannot learn *for* us, feel *for* us, or act *for* us because this would be contrary to the doctrine of agency. He can facilitate opportunities and invite us to learn, feel, and act."

Implication: Teachers must not try to learn *for* their students, feel *for* them, or repent *for* them. The question shifts from "What can I do for my students?" to "How do I invite and help them to learn for themselves?"

### The Spirit-Teacher-Learner Dynamic

Three possible misalignments (Richardson):

1. **Teaching "in front of" the Spirit** — Taking over, doing everything ourselves, not leaving room for the Spirit to work
2. **Teaching "behind" the Spirit** — Being unprepared, hoping the Spirit will bail us out ("winging it")
3. **Teaching "by" the Spirit** — Aligning our manner with the Spirit's manner so the Spirit can teach unrestrained

Only the third produces genuine conversion.

## Part 4: The Teacher's Preparation

### Personal Spiritual Preparation Is Primary

The First Presidency: "The most important part of your service will be your own daily spiritual preparation, including prayer, scripture study, and obedience to the commandments."

David M. McConkie underscores this: "It is significant that the First Presidency did not say that the most important part of your service is to prepare your lesson well or to master various teaching techniques."

Lesson preparation matters—but it is secondary to personal worthiness and spiritual readiness.

### Having Both Word and Power

McConkie identifies two incomplete approaches:

1. "Some focus their attention only on obtaining the word, and they become experts in delivering information."
2. "Others neglect their preparation and hope that the Lord in His goodness will somehow help them get through the class period."

Neither works. "In order to successfully teach the gospel, you must have both the word and the power of the gospel in your life."

### The Promise of Revelation

When a teacher has done the work—lived the gospel, searched the scriptures, treasured them up—the Holy Ghost will:

1. Reveal the words anew to the teacher personally, so they become "your words"
2. "Bring all things to your remembrance"
3. Give "in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say"

McConkie: "When this happens, you will find yourself saying something that you did not plan to say. Then, if you will pay attention, you will learn something from the things that you say when you teach."

Marion G. Romney: "I always know when I am speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost because I always learn something from what I've said."

## Part 5: What Conversion Actually Looks Like

### The Relationship Between Doctrine and Conversion

Mark L. Pace (April 2022): "The aim of all gospel learning and teaching is to deepen our conversion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. … The kind of gospel learning that strengthens our faith and leads to the miracle of conversion doesn't happen all at once. It extends beyond a classroom into our hearts and homes. It requires consistent, daily efforts to understand and live the gospel."

The miracle: "When one person has an experience in the scriptures and that experience is blessed by the influence of the Holy Ghost."

### Conversion Requires Personal Experience

> "To be most effective, your experiences with the scriptures must be your own. Reading or hearing about another person's experiences and insights can be helpful, but that won't bring the same converting power. There is no substitute for the time *you* spend in the scriptures, hearing the Holy Ghost speak directly to *you*."

This has direct implications for teaching: We cannot convert people by telling them about our conversion. We can only create conditions where they might experience their own.

### Conversion as Becoming, Not Just Knowing

Elder Ashton: "Repentance causes us to become 'true followers' of Christ. ... Through repentance we become submissive and obedient to God's will."

The doctrine of Christ is not a knowledge system to master. It is a transformation system to undergo. The goal is not theological sophistication but Christlike character.

### The Sacrament as Weekly Conversion Catalyst

Ashton offers a practical method: "Make a conscious effort each week to prepare for the sacrament by taking some time to prayerfully consider where we most need to improve. We could then bring a sacrifice of at least one thing that keeps us from being like Jesus Christ to the sacrament altar, pleading in faith for help, asking for necessary spiritual gifts, and covenanting to improve during the coming week."

## Part 6: Principles for Teaching Doctrine

### Principle 1: You Are on the Lord's Errand

McConkie: "You are His agent, and you are authorized and commissioned to represent Him and to act on His behalf. As His agent, you are entitled to His help."

The question every teacher must ask: "What would the Savior say if He were teaching my class today, and how would He say it?"

### Principle 2: Teach Doctrine, Not Opinion

McConkie: "You are called to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. You must not teach your own ideas or philosophy, even mingled with scriptures. The gospel is 'the power of God unto salvation,' and it is only through the gospel that we are saved."

This requires:
- Teaching from standard works
- Teaching the words of modern prophets and apostles
- Teaching what the Holy Ghost directs

### Principle 3: Listen Before Speaking

Elder Holland (quoted by McConkie): "Second only to the responsibility teachers have to listen to the Spirit, is the responsibility they have to listen to the student. … If we'll listen with spiritual ears, our students will tell us what lessons they need to hear!"

The critique: "The fact of the matter is teachers are still too focused on delivering comfortable, repetitious lesson content rather than focusing on their students as individuals."

### Principle 4: Be Willing to Let Go

McConkie: "After you have prepared yourself and your lesson to the very best of your ability, you must be willing to let go. When the quiet promptings of the Holy Ghost come, you must have the courage to set aside your outlines and your notes and go where those promptings take you."

Result: "When you do this, the lesson you deliver is no longer your lesson, but it becomes the Savior's lesson."

### Principle 5: Stand as an Independent Witness

McConkie: "You must stand as an independent witness of the things you teach and not just be an echo of the words in a manual or the thoughts of others."

Teachers don't merely report what prophets have said. They testify of what they know to be true because the Spirit has confirmed it to them personally.

### Principle 6: Teach for Repetition and Iteration

Renlund: "I invite you to live the doctrine of Christ repeatedly, iteratively, and intentionally."

Teaching doctrine means helping people understand that conversion is not a destination but a pattern—a cycle to be lived again and again, each time going deeper.

### Principle 7: Minister Like the Guide (Not the Judge)

Renlund's kayak guide provides the model for how to help those who are struggling:

What he did NOT do:
- Shout unhelpful questions from afar
- Chide or criticize
- Start helping before the person was ready
- Correct publicly

What he DID do:
- Came close
- Gave practical help when needed
- Towed when necessary
- Gave advice when the person was receptive
- Encouraged repeatedly

> "As we minister, we do not need to ask unhelpful questions or state the obvious. Most people who are struggling know that they are struggling. We should not be judgmental; our judgment is neither helpful nor welcome, and it is most often ill-informed."

## Part 7: Synthesis — A Unified Theory

### The Core Model

Teaching doctrine effectively requires alignment across three dimensions:

**1. The Teacher's Preparation**
- Personal righteousness and daily spiritual habits
- Deep familiarity with scripture (the "word")
- Prayer, fasting, and living worthy of the Spirit (the "power")
- Willingness to be an instrument, not the source

**2. The Teaching Moment**
- Teaching by the Spirit, not in front of or behind it
- Teaching people, not lessons
- Listening to learners to understand what they need
- Courage to follow promptings and depart from plans
- Standing as a personal witness, not merely an echo

**3. The Learner's Agency**
- Creating conditions for personal experience with scripture
- Inviting action and commitment, not just understanding
- Respecting that the Spirit cannot (and will not) override agency
- Pointing toward the ongoing cycle of faith-repentance-covenant-Spirit

### The Ultimate Goal

The goal is not that learners leave knowing more.

The goal is that learners leave *changed*—or at least with the seeds of change planted, with invitations to act on what the Spirit has taught them.

Conversion happens "when one person has an experience in the scriptures and that experience is blessed by the influence of the Holy Ghost."

The teacher's role is to create the conditions for that experience.

## For Teacher Council Meeting

### Opening / Check-In (5-10 min)

**Warm-up**: "How are things going in your calling? Any recent teaching moments—good or hard—that are on your mind?"

Let people share briefly. This gets them talking and surfaces what's actually happening in their classrooms.

**Transition to Topic**: "Think about a time you were teaching and you felt like the Spirit was really present—something clicked, hearts were touched. What was different about that experience?"

Or alternatively: "When you're preparing a lesson, where do you spend most of your time and energy? What feels hardest about preparation?"

These questions get teachers reflecting on their own practice before diving into principles.

---

### Possible Discussion Questions During the Focused Dive

- "Elder McConkie said personal spiritual preparation is *more important* than lesson preparation. What do you think that means practically? How do we balance both?"

- "The idea of teaching 'people, not lessons'—what would that actually look like in your class this Sunday?"

- "D&C 42:14 says if we don't have the Spirit, we shouldn't teach. That's pretty stark. What do we do with that?"

- "Elder Richardson talks about teaching 'in front of' the Spirit (doing too much) vs. 'behind' the Spirit (unprepared, hoping to be bailed out). Which tendency do you lean toward?"

---

### Application / Wrap-Up (5-10 min)

Invite teachers to choose ONE thing to try before the next teacher council:

1. **The Preparation Shift**: "This week, spend as much time in personal scripture study and prayer *preparing yourself spiritually* as you do preparing your lesson outline. See what changes."

2. **The Listening Experiment**: "In your next lesson, build in a moment where you genuinely pause and listen—to the Spirit and to your class members. Let what you hear shape what you teach next."

3. **Teach Less, Go Deeper**: "Pick one principle from your lesson and really dwell there. Instead of covering five points quickly, let the class wrestle with one truth until it lands."

4. **Personal Witness**: "Find one moment in your next lesson to share what *you* know—not just what the manual says, but what the Spirit has confirmed to you personally."

**Closing thought**: The goal isn't that our class members leave knowing more. The goal is that they leave *changed*—or at least with an invitation to act on what the Spirit taught them. We're not information dispensers. We're instruments in the Lord's hands.

---

### Optional: Teacher Self-Assessment Questions

Questions teachers could take home and ponder:

- Am I more focused on covering content or on inviting conversion?
- Do I prepare myself spiritually as carefully as I prepare my lesson materials?
- When I teach, do I leave room for the Spirit to work, or do I fill every moment?
- Do I really listen to my class members, or am I mostly waiting to deliver my next point?
- Can I stand as an independent witness of what I teach, or am I just echoing the manual?
- What would the Savior say if He were teaching my class this Sunday?
