# "Blessed Are the Peacemakers": A Deep-Dive Analysis

## Elder Gary E. Stevenson's October 2025 General Conference Address --- Mashed Up with Scripture, Scholarship, and the Prophetic Chorus

---

> "Can I truly become a peacemaker when the world is in commotion, when my heart is filled with fear, and when peace seems so far away?"

That question --- placed in the mouth of a teenager walking home from the Sermon on the Mount, and then echoed by the rising generation of 2025 --- is the beating heart of Elder Gary E. Stevenson's October 2025 General Conference talk. The answer both times is yes. But the *how* of that yes is where things get interesting, because Stevenson's address, deliberately or not, maps onto a remarkably deep body of research in psychology, peace studies, developmental science, and conflict resolution --- not to mention two thousand years of scriptural theology on what it actually means to *make* peace.

What follows is an attempt to crack the talk open and let all of its themes breathe.

---

## 1. The Word Itself: *Eirenopoioi*

Start with the Greek. In [Matthew 5:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.9), the word translated "peacemakers" is *eirenopoioi* --- a compound of *eirene* (peace) and *poieo* (to make, to do, to construct). It appears exactly once in the entire New Testament. This is not a passive word. It does not describe people who are *peaceful*, or people who *keep* the peace, or people who simply *prefer* peace. It describes people who *manufacture* peace where none exists. Builders. Constructors. Artisans of reconciliation.

The Hebrew concept underneath is even richer. *Shalom* --- the peace that *eirene* translates --- is not merely the absence of conflict. In the Hebrew Bible, *shalom* denotes wholeness, completeness, soundness, welfare, and flourishing. When Isaiah proclaims, "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that publisheth peace" ([Isaiah 52:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/52.7)), the word carries the full weight of cosmic restoration --- a world made right.

This distinction matters enormously for reading Stevenson's talk. He is not preaching quietism. He is not saying "just be nice." He is describing an active, constructive, courageous discipline. As he puts it: "To be a peacemaker is not to be weak but to be strong in a way that the world may not understand."

Modern peace studies, founded by Norwegian sociologist Johan Galtung in the late 1950s, draws exactly this same line. Galtung distinguished between *negative peace* (the mere absence of direct violence) and *positive peace* (the active presence of justice, equity, and human flourishing). Elder Stevenson's talk is a sermon on positive peace. It is not about avoiding fights. It is about building something.

---

## 2. The Sermon on the Mount as Subversive Politics

Stevenson's rhetorical stroke of genius is to begin in first-century Galilee. "Imagine with me you are a young teenager in Capernaum," he says. This is not mere scene-setting. It is a theological claim about the enduring relevance of the Beatitudes.

Consider the political reality of that teenager's life. Galilee in the late 20s AD was under Roman occupation. The *Pax Romana* --- the "Roman Peace" --- was maintained by legions, crucifixions, and the constant threat of imperial violence. "Peace" in the Roman vocabulary meant submission. It was stamped on coins. It was proclaimed by Caesar Augustus, who called himself *divi filius* --- son of God.

Into that context, Jesus of Nazareth stands on a hillside and says: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God."

The language is not accidental. To declare that *peacemakers* --- not emperors, not legions --- are the true "sons of God" is to challenge the entire Roman political theology. The real peace does not come from Caesar's sword. It comes from those who turn the other cheek, who love their enemies, who refuse to let violence have the last word.

This is the world Stevenson's imagined teenager walks home through. Dusty roads. An occupied country. Fear and uncertainty. And a radical new claim that peace is something you *make* --- from the inside out.

---

## 3. The Concentric Circles: Heart, Home, Community

The architecture of Stevenson's talk is deceptively simple. He organizes his entire message around three expanding spheres of peacemaking:

1. **The Heart** --- inner transformation
2. **The Home** --- family relationships
3. **The Community** --- the wider world

This is not just a sermon outline. It is a model --- and it has profound support in both scripture and social science.

### The Ecological Model

In 1979, developmental psychologist Urie Bronfenbrenner published his landmark *Ecological Systems Theory*, which describes human development as occurring within nested, concentric environmental systems: the *microsystem* (family, immediate interactions), the *mesosystem* (connections between microsystems), the *exosystem* (community structures), and the *macrosystem* (cultural values). Changes at the innermost level ripple outward.

More directly, peace scholar Laura K. Taylor (2020) developed the *Developmental Peacebuilding Model*, which explicitly combines Bronfenbrenner's framework with John Paul Lederach's peacebuilding paradigm. Studying 590 adolescents in Northern Ireland, Taylor identified four profiles: "Peace in Name Only," "Peace at Home," "Peace Within Community," and "Future Peacebuilder." The progression is precisely Stevenson's: you start from the inside and work out.

### The Scriptural Model

The Book of Mormon provides the most vivid illustration of this concentric pattern in action. After Christ's visit to the Nephites --- where He delivered the same Sermon on the Mount, including "blessed are all the peacemakers" ([3 Nephi 12:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.9)) --- an extraordinary society emerged:

> "There was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people." ([4 Nephi 1:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.15))

> "And there were no envyings, nor strifes, nor tumults ... and surely there could not be a happier people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God." ([4 Nephi 1:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.16))

Note the sequence. The love of God dwelt *in the hearts* of the people first. Then contention disappeared from the land. Heart first. Community second. Exactly Stevenson's model.

King Benjamin teaches the same principle. When people truly know "the glory of God," he says, they "will not have a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably" ([Mosiah 4:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.13)). The inner transformation --- a new *mind* --- precedes the outward peace.

And Doctrine and Covenants 121:41 gives the operational manual for the home layer: "persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness and meekness, and love unfeigned." Stevenson explicitly cites this verse as the Lord's pattern for family peacemaking. It is worth noting that every single term in that list describes a *sustained internal posture*, not a technique. You cannot fake long-suffering. You cannot manufacture love unfeigned. The work begins in the heart.

---

## 4. Children Know Something We Forgot

One of the most striking sections of Stevenson's talk is when he steps away from formal theology and simply asks Primary-age children: "What does it look like to be a peacemaker?"

Their answers are remarkable in their directness:

- **Luke**: "Always help others."
- **Grace**: Forgive each other, even when it doesn't feel fair.
- **Anna**: "I saw someone who didn't have anyone to play with, so I went to play with her."
- **Lindy**: Help others. "Then you pass it on. It will just keep going on and on."
- **Liam**: "Don't be mean to people, even if they are mean to you."
- **Trevor**: "If there is one donut left and you all want it, you share."

Stevenson draws a theological conclusion: "These children's responses are evidence to me that we are all born with divine inclinations toward kindness and compassion."

The developmental psychology is stunning in its alignment.

### The Warneken-Tomasello Experiments

Felix Warneken and Michael Tomasello at the Max Planck Institute demonstrated in a series of landmark studies (published in *Science*, 2006) that **infants as young as 14 months spontaneously help adults achieve goals** --- picking up dropped objects, opening cabinet doors for someone whose hands are full. By 18 months, children reliably help in a wide variety of situations, without being asked and without any reward.

Even more striking: when researchers introduced *external rewards* for helping, children's intrinsic motivation to help actually *decreased*. The children weren't helping because someone told them to. They were helping because something inside them wanted to.

Subsequent research by Svetlova et al. (2010) showed that prosocial development progresses from *instrumental helping* (action-based) to *empathic helping* (emotion-based) to *altruistic helping* (costly self-sacrifice). The youngest children master instrumental helping first. Empathic helping --- responding to another person's emotional distress --- increases significantly between 18 and 24 months. And altruistic helping --- giving up something you want for someone else --- is the hardest and the latest to develop.

Trevor's donut insight is, developmentally speaking, the most advanced form of prosocial behavior. He is describing altruistic helping: costly, voluntary sharing. And Lindy's observation --- "you pass it on, it will just keep going on and on" --- is a child's intuitive description of what researchers call *upstream reciprocity* or the *pay-it-forward effect*, which has been robustly confirmed in experimental economics.

Stevenson's theological claim --- that children are born with "divine inclinations toward kindness and compassion" --- and the empirical evidence from developmental psychology are saying essentially the same thing in different registers. The impulse toward peace is not something we have to install in human beings from the outside. It is already there. The gospel *nurtures and knits* it, as Stevenson says, but it does not create it from nothing. There is something to build on.

## 5. The Kindness Experiment: Psychology of De-escalation

The central narrative of Stevenson's talk is a family story. Children were struggling with an adult whose behavior was "grumpy, condescending, and curt." They began mirroring the hostility. Then the family met together and decided on an experiment: instead of retaliation, they would respond with "a deliberate, heartfelt outpouring of kind words and thoughtful deeds, no matter how they were treated in return."

The result: "The cold exchanges began to thaw. Smiles replaced scowls. The adult, once distant and harsh, began to change."

This is not sentimentality. The psychology of de-escalation explains exactly why this works --- and why it is so hard.

### Reflexive Escalation vs. Deliberate De-escalation

A 2019 study by Seip et al. in the *Journal of Experimental Social Psychology* found that negative reciprocity naturally *escalates* --- people tend to punish harder than they were punished, "taking two eyes for an eye." This escalation is reflexive, not strategic. It happens automatically unless something intervenes.

That something is **deliberation**. When participants in the experiments were encouraged to think carefully before responding, escalation decreased dramatically. When deliberation was disabled (through time pressure or cognitive load), escalation increased. The family in Stevenson's story did precisely this: they paused, talked openly, and made a *deliberate choice* to break the cycle.

### The Pay-It-Forward Cascade

Research by Nicholas Epley and colleagues has shown that acts of kindness are routinely *underestimated* by the giver and *deeply valued* by the receiver. Recipients of unexpected kindness then go on to treat *others* more generously --- the pay-it-forward effect that Lindy the Primary child intuitively understood.

### The D&C 121 Connection

Stevenson ties the family's experiment to the pattern in [Doctrine and Covenants 121:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41): "persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, and meekness, and love unfeigned." This verse, given to Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail during one of the darkest periods of early Church history, is itself a profound statement about responding to hostility with deliberate love. Joseph was in a dungeon. The Saints were being driven from Missouri. And the Lord's instruction was not to fight back but to influence through patience, gentleness, and authentic love. The verse is a recipe for exactly the kind of experiment Stevenson describes.

## 6. Peacemaking as Moral Courage

"Peacemakers are sometimes labeled naive or weak --- from all sides," Stevenson observes. "Yet, to be a peacemaker is not to be weak but to be strong in a way that the world may not understand."

This theme --- the paradox of peace as strength --- runs through the entire prophetic tradition on peacemaking. President Nelson in 2023 was equally direct: "Being a peacemaker does not require us to agree with the ideas or beliefs of others." Elder Andersen in 2022 framed it memorably: "Peacemakers are not passive; they are persuasive in the Savior's way."

The psychology of moral courage provides rigorous support for this claim.

### What Makes a Peacemaker Strong, Not Weak

Research by Baumert et al. (2020) defines moral courage as the willingness to stand up against moral violations despite personal risk. The key psychological ingredient is **self-efficacy** --- the belief that your actions can make a difference. People who exercise moral courage don't see themselves as weak or passive. They see themselves as agents who can change outcomes.

Samuel and Pearl Oliner's landmark study of Holocaust rescuers (*The Altruistic Personality*, 1988) found that rescuers had broad, inclusive self-images and a strong sense of personal agency. Bystanders --- the people who did *not* act --- were the ones who described themselves as weak and powerless. The courageous ones were not the fighters. They were the helpers.

### The Anti-Ammon People

The Book of Mormon offers perhaps the most radical example of peacemaking courage in all of scripture. The converted Lamanites in Alma 24 --- the Anti-Nephi-Lehies --- "buried their weapons of war, for peace" ([Alma 24:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24.19)). When their enemies came against them, they prostrated themselves on the ground and allowed themselves to be killed rather than take up arms again. This was not weakness. The text calls them "firm" --- they "would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin."

President Nelson explicitly invoked this story in his 2023 peacemaker address: "Now is the time to bury your weapons of war." The allusion reframes disarmament --- literal and verbal --- as an act of supreme spiritual strength.

---

## 7. Digital Peacemaking: Publishing Peace

Stevenson's "one-week peacemaker plan" includes a striking challenge for the digital age: "Before posting, replying, or commenting online, ask, *Will this build a bridge?* If not, stop. Do not send. Instead, share goodness. Publish peace in the place of hate."

That last phrase --- "publish peace" --- echoes Isaiah: "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that publisheth peace" ([Isaiah 52:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/52.7)). Stevenson is recontextualizing Isaiah for the era of social media. To "publish peace" in 2025 means posting it, sharing it, amplifying it.

The research on digital civility strongly supports the pause-before-posting approach.

### What the Science Shows

- **Pausing works.** The Seip et al. (2019) escalation research demonstrates that deliberation reduces reflexive negative responses. Experts recommend a minimum 5-minute pause before posting any emotionally charged comment. The faster you react, the less thoughtful your response.

- **Civil discourse builds trust.** A study by Antoci et al. (2019) in the *Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization* found that participants exposed to civil Facebook interactions became significantly more trusting --- even toward people they disagreed with. The researchers noted: "A simple lack of aggression in expressing a difference of opinions online acts as a powerful determinant of higher levels of trust."

- **Incivility has chilling effects.** Twenty-seven percent of Americans have decided not to post something after witnessing others' online harassment. The toxicity of digital spaces doesn't just hurt the targets --- it silences bystanders.

- **Microsoft's Digital Civility Index** tracks four principles that closely mirror Stevenson's framework: live the golden rule, respect differences, pause before replying, and stand up for yourself and others.

Elder Andersen's 2022 observation is particularly relevant here: "In a world of social media and information superhighways, one person's voice can be multiplied exponentially. That voice, whether true or false, whether fair or prejudicial, whether kind or cruel, moves instantly across the world." The same technology that amplifies rage can amplify peace. The question is what we choose to publish.

---

## 8. Forgiveness as Mechanism

"To be peacemakers, we forgive others and deliberately build others up instead of tearing them down," Stevenson says. Forgiveness isn't just a nice idea in this talk --- it is the *mechanism* by which peace is constructed. Every story in the talk involves forgiveness at its core: the family forgiving a difficult adult, the Nigerian imam and pastor forgiving each other for religious violence, even the Primary children describing fairness and letting go of grievances.

### The Two Models

The field of forgiveness psychology is dominated by two evidence-based frameworks:

1. **Robert Enright's Process Model** --- forgiveness as a moral gift extended to an offender, moving through four phases: Uncovering (recognizing the depth of the hurt), Decision (choosing to forgive), Work (developing empathy and compassion for the offender), and Deepening (finding meaning in the suffering).

2. **Everett Worthington's REACH Model** --- Recall the hurt, Empathize with the offender, give an Altruistic gift of forgiveness, Commit to forgiveness, and Hold on to forgiveness over time.

A comprehensive meta-analysis by Wade et al. (2014) covering all randomized controlled trials on forgiveness found that participants increased their forgiveness approximately 0.1 standard deviations per hour of treatment. Both models produced significant improvements in forgiveness, depression, anxiety, PTSD symptoms, self-esteem, and what psychologists call "environmental mastery" --- the sense that you can shape your own life.

Worthington makes a critical distinction between *decisional forgiveness* (a behavioral commitment to treat the offender differently) and *emotional forgiveness* (an actual transformation of negative emotions into positive ones). The decision comes first. The emotions follow. This maps perfectly onto Stevenson's family story: the children *decided* to respond with kindness before they *felt* kind. The feelings changed later --- "smiles replaced scowls."

### Ashafa and Wuye: Forgiveness at Scale

The most dramatic illustration in Stevenson's talk is the story of Imam Muhammad Ashafa and Pastor James Wuye from Nigeria. These two men once stood on opposite sides of a violent religious divide. Each had suffered deeply --- Wuye lost his hand in an act of religious violence. Yet through forgiveness, they chose reconciliation. They founded the Interfaith Mediation Centre, which now has over 20,000 members and has mediated peace agreements across multiple Nigerian states. In March 2025, they received the inaugural Commonwealth Peace Prize.

Their story is living evidence that James was right: "The fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace" ([James 3:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/3.18)). Forgiveness is not the end of the peacemaking process. It is the seed from which everything else grows.

---

## 9. The Prophetic Chorus: A Crescendo on Peace

Stevenson's talk does not stand alone. It arrives as part of an extraordinary multi-year emphasis on peacemaking from the leadership of the Church. Consider the trajectory:

- **2022, April** --- Elder Neil L. Andersen: "Following Jesus: Being a Peacemaker." Key line: "Peacemakers are not passive; they are persuasive in the Savior's way."

- **2023, April** --- President Russell M. Nelson: "Peacemakers Needed." Key line: "Contention is a choice. Peacemaking is a choice. You have your agency to choose contention or reconciliation."

- **2025, October** --- Elder Gary E. Stevenson: "Blessed Are the Peacemakers." Key line: "To be a peacemaker is not to be weak but to be strong in a way that the world may not understand."

Each talk builds on the previous ones. Andersen established that peacemaking is active, not passive. Nelson declared that contention is satanic and that charity is the antidote. Stevenson provides the practical framework --- heart, home, community --- and the actionable one-week plan.

Together, they form a prophetic chorus that has been building for years. And each of them returns to the same verse: "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God" ([Matthew 5:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.9)).

The Book of Mormon's term for the people who live this way is "the peaceable followers of Christ" --- Mormon's phrase from [Moroni 7:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.3), used to describe the community he addresses in what is arguably the most profound sermon on faith, hope, and charity in all of scripture. Mormon identifies them by their "peaceable walk with the children of men" ([Moroni 7:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.4)). Not their theology. Not their orthodoxy. Their *walk* --- the way they move through the world.

---

## 10. The Seventh Beatitude: Structure and Significance

One detail worth pausing on: "Blessed are the peacemakers" is the **seventh** Beatitude in the Sermon on the Mount. In Hebrew numerology, seven signifies completeness and perfection. Whether or not Jesus intended a numerological structure, the position is suggestive. The Beatitudes build on each other --- from poverty of spirit, to mourning, to meekness, to hunger for righteousness, to mercy, to purity of heart --- and then, at the climax, peacemaking.

Read this way, peacemaking is not one virtue among many. It is the *culmination* --- the fruit that grows when all the other Beatitudes are internalized. You cannot be a peacemaker if you are not first poor in spirit (humble), mourning (empathetic), meek (disciplined), hungry for righteousness (principled), merciful (forgiving), and pure in heart (sincere). Peacemaking integrates them all.

This may be why Stevenson's talk begins in the heart. You cannot skip to community peacemaking without doing the interior work first. The seventh Beatitude presupposes the first six.

---

## 11. The Promise: "They Shall Be Called the Children of God"

The promise attached to peacemaking is unique among the Beatitudes: "they shall be called the children of God." As Elder Andersen pointed out in 2022, every person is the *offspring* of God ([Acts 17:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/17.28)), but to be *called* the children of God "means much, much more." It is a covenantal identity. It is adoption into the divine family in the fullest sense --- becoming "his seed" and "heirs of the kingdom" ([Mosiah 15:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.11)), "children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters" ([Mosiah 5:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.7)).

This reframes the entire discussion. Peacemaking is not just a moral ideal or a social strategy. It is an *identity claim*. When you make peace, you reveal whose child you are. You demonstrate your family resemblance to the Prince of Peace. The Latin title of Jesus --- *Rex Pacificus* --- means not just "peaceful king" but "peace-making king." He doesn't just possess peace; He constructs it, at infinite personal cost, through the Atonement.

Stevenson's concluding testimony points here: "We fulfill our divine role as children of a loving Heavenly Father as we strive to become peacemakers."

---

## 12. The One-Week Plan: Practicality as Theology

Stevenson closes with a disarmingly simple invitation: a one-week, three-step peacemaker plan.

1. **Contention-free home zone**: "When contention starts, pause and reboot with kind words and deeds."
2. **Digital bridge building**: "Before posting, replying, or commenting online, ask, *Will this build a bridge?*"
3. **Repair and reunite**: "Seek out a strained relationship in order to apologize, minister, repair, and reunite."

The simplicity is the point. Galtung's peace studies, Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems, Worthington's forgiveness models, Warneken's infant experiments --- all of that rigorous scholarship points to the same conclusion: peace is built in small, deliberate, repeated acts of kindness, restraint, and repair. It is not waiting for a grand geopolitical breakthrough. It is one family dinner, one deleted tweet, one phone call to a sibling you haven't spoken to in months.

As Elder Widtsoe said in 1943 --- the year Galtung would have been thirteen years old: "The only way to build a peaceful community is to build men and women who are lovers and makers of peace. Each individual ... holds in his hands the peace of the whole world."

That is what Stevenson is asking for. Not world peace in the abstract. Peace in the hand. Peace in the home. Peace published from the heart outward, one concentric circle at a time.
