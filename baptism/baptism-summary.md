## 2. The Proper Mode: Baptism by Immersion

The scriptures are clear that baptism must be performed by complete immersion in water, symbolizing death, burial, and resurrection.

Water baptism is incomplete without the subsequent baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, which sanctifies and purifies the soul.

## 8. Infant Baptism Is Not Necessary

The Book of Mormon clearly teaches that little children do not need baptism, as they are innocent before God.

**Key Scriptures:**

- Children who die before the age of accountability are saved in the celestial kingdom ([D&C 137:10](../standard-works-vault/Doctrine and Covenants/D&C 137.10.md))

## 9. Baptism for the Dead

God has provided a way for those who died without the opportunity to be baptized to receive this essential ordinance through proxy baptism.

**Key Scriptures:**
- "Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?" ([1 Corinthians 15:29](../standard-works-vault/New Testament/1 Corinthians 15.29.md))
- "Herein is glory and honor, and immortality and eternal life—The ordinance of baptism by water, to be immersed therein in order to answer to the likeness of the dead." ([D&C 128:12](../standard-works-vault/Doctrine and Covenants/D&C 128.12.md))
- "For I confer upon you a mission to prepare the way before me for the salvation of his people—And for this end have I raised you up, that I might show forth my wisdom through the weak things of the earth." ([D&C 127:2](../standard-works-vault/Doctrine and Covenants/D&C 127.2.md))
- "They without us cannot be made perfect—neither can we without our dead be made perfect." ([D&C 128:15](../standard-works-vault/Doctrine and Covenants/D&C 128.15.md))

## 10. Jesus Christ's Baptism: The Perfect Example

Christ himself was baptized, setting the perfect example for all mankind.

**Key Scriptures:**
- "Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him. But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness." ([Matthew 3:13-15](../standard-works-vault/New Testament/Matthew 3.13.md))
- "And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!" ([2 Nephi 31:5](../standard-works-vault/Book of Mormon/2 Nephi 31.5.md))
- "Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?" ([2 Nephi 31:10](../standard-works-vault/Book of Mormon/2 Nephi 31.10.md))

## 11. Baptism as a Covenant Relationship

Baptism is not merely a ritual but establishes a covenant relationship with God.

**Key Scriptures:**
- "As a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments." ([Mosiah 18:10](../standard-works-vault/Book of Mormon/Mosiah 18.10.md))
- "Willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ, having a determination to serve him to the end." ([D&C 20:37](../standard-works-vault/Doctrine and Covenants/D&C 20.37.md))
- "All those who are baptized... are received by baptism into his church." ([D&C 20:37](../standard-works-vault/Doctrine and Covenants/D&C 20.37.md))

## 12. Unity and Oneness Through Baptism

Baptism brings us into the body of Christ and unifies believers.

**Key Scriptures:**
- "For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body." ([1 Corinthians 12:13](../standard-works-vault/New Testament/1 Corinthians 12.13.md))
- "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ." ([Galatians 3:27](../standard-works-vault/New Testament/Galatians 3.27.md))
- "One Lord, one faith, one baptism." ([Ephesians 4:5](../standard-works-vault/New Testament/Ephesians 4.5.md))

## Conclusion

Baptism is a fundamental ordinance of the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is:
- Essential for salvation
- Performed by immersion in water
- Administered by proper priesthood authority
- Done in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
- A covenant to take Christ's name and serve Him
- A gateway to receiving the Holy Ghost
- Available to all through baptism for the dead
- The first step on the covenant path back to our Heavenly Father

As like the ancient Israelites who passed through the Red Sea to leave bondage behind, baptism represents our commitment to leave sin behind and enter into a covenant relationship with Jesus Christ, walking in newness of life toward eternal glory.
