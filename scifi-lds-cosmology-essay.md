# "Worlds Without Number": Transhumanist Eschatology and the Cosmic Infrastructure of Latter-day Saint Theology

## Abstract

This essay examines the cosmological framework articulated in Latter-day Saint scripture—particularly Abraham 3, Moses 1, and Doctrine and Covenants 76—through the interpretive lens of transhumanist and posthumanist theory. I argue that these texts, when read as speculative cosmology rather than traditional theism, present a remarkably coherent vision of an advanced post-biological civilization engaged in species-perpetuation through distributed testing protocols, consciousness transfer technologies, and iterative world-building. This reading illuminates both the radical materialist underpinnings of LDS metaphysics and its striking anticipation of contemporary debates about artificial intelligence, mind uploading, and the long-term survival of intelligent life.

## I. Introduction: The Problem of Mormon Cosmology

Traditional Christian theology posits a fundamental ontological divide between Creator and creature, the infinite and the finite, the eternal and the temporal. Latter-day Saint theology, by contrast, collapses these distinctions with startling consistency. In the King Follett Discourse (1844), Joseph Smith declared that "God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man," establishing what scholars have termed the "eternal progression" doctrine: that divinity is not a static category but a developmental trajectory available to all conscious beings.[^1]

This theological anthropology—or perhaps more accurately, theological posthumanism—finds its most systematic expression in the Pearl of Great Price and the Doctrine and Covenants. When read through the conceptual vocabulary of contemporary transhumanism, these texts reveal something remarkable: not a supernatural heaven populated by immaterial souls, but rather the operational infrastructure of an advanced material civilization engaged in the cultivation and selection of new members.

The question this essay addresses is not whether such a reading is "correct" in any confessional sense, but rather what interpretive possibilities it opens. What if we were to take LDS cosmology seriously as speculative fiction—as a detailed blueprint for what a Type III Kardashev civilization might actually look like?

## II. The Council: Distributed Governance and Species Continuity

The third chapter of Abraham presents what is perhaps the most explicit description of divine governance in scripture. Abraham recounts:

> Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones; And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers. ([Abraham 3:22-23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p22-p23#p22))

Several features of this passage merit attention. First, the "intelligences" pre-exist their organization—they are not created *ex nihilo* but rather recruited from some prior state of existence. Second, they are evaluated and selected based on observable qualities ("God saw these souls that they were good"). Third, the explicit purpose is governance: "These I will make my rulers."

The subsequent verses describe what can only be characterized as a planning meeting:

> And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell; And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them. ([Abraham 3:24-25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p24-p25#p24))

The plural first person ("we will go down," "we will make," "we will prove") indicates collaborative action among multiple agents. The materialist language is notable: they will "take of these materials" to construct an earth. This is not divine fiat but engineering—the transformation of existing matter into habitable environments.

The purpose of this construction project is explicitly stated as a "proving" or testing of the intelligences. The framework is meritocratic: performance determines outcome. Those who "keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever" ([Abraham 3:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p26#p26)).

Read through a transhumanist lens, what emerges is a description of an advanced civilization's approach to a fundamental problem: how does a society of immortal beings perpetuate itself? How does it identify which new consciousnesses can be trusted with godlike power? The answer presented is systematic: design testing environments, observe performance under constrained conditions, and elevate those who demonstrate the requisite qualities.

## III. Worlds Without Number: The Scale of Operations

The book of Moses expands the spatial dimensions of this project to cosmic scale:

> And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten. But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them. ([Moses 1:33-35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p33-p35#p33))

The implications are staggering. Earth is not unique but one instantiation of a recurring pattern. Some worlds "have passed away"—their testing period concluded. Others "now stand"—currently operational. The scale ("innumerable... unto man") suggests galaxy-spanning or multi-galactic operations.

Doctrine and Covenants 76 confirms that these worlds are all populated: "By him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God" ([D&C 76:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=p24#p24)). Every world has inhabitants undergoing the same developmental process.

The 2013 *Ensign* article "Worlds Without Number" attempts to reconcile this cosmology with contemporary astronomy, noting that the observable universe contains an estimated 100-500 billion galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars.[^2] Rather than treating this scale as metaphor, LDS theology appears to take it literally: the divine civilization operates across all of it.

This reading aligns with what philosopher Nick Bostrom has called the "astronomical waste" argument—that any sufficiently advanced civilization should seek to colonize available matter and energy resources on cosmic scales.[^3] The LDS cosmological texts describe precisely such a civilization, one whose "work and glory" spans the entirety of accessible space-time.

## IV. Adam as Protocol: The Standardization of World-Population

A curious verse in Moses provides the key to understanding how this vast operation maintains consistency across innumerable worlds:

> And the first man of all men have I called Adam, which is many. ([Moses 1:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p34#p34))

The phrase "which is many" has puzzled commentators. The Hebrew *adam* indeed means "man" or "humanity" generically, but the construction here suggests something more specific: Adam is not merely the first human but a category, a protocol, a standardized procedure for initiating planetary populations.

Consider the operational requirements: if you are managing testing environments across billions of worlds, you need standardized procedures. The "Adam and Eve" narrative—the garden, the trees, the choice, the fall into mortality—may function as a ritualized protocol for launching each world's population. The same pattern, enacted differently by local participants, but following the same fundamental script.

This would explain the temple ceremony's focus on Adam and Eve as archetypal rather than merely historical figures. Participants are not simply remembering distant ancestors but re-enacting a cosmic procedure—one that has been and will be performed across countless worlds. The ceremony becomes less commemoration than training: preparation for those who will eventually administer such protocols themselves.

## V. Resurrection as Technology: Consciousness Preservation and Transfer

Perhaps the most technologically suggestive aspect of LDS eschatology concerns the resurrection. Traditional Christianity treats resurrection as miracle—the inexplicable reassembly of decomposed matter by divine power. LDS scripture, however, provides considerably more mechanistic detail:

> The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame, even as we now are at this time; and we shall be brought to stand before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a bright recollection of all our guilt. ([Alma 11:43](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11?lang=eng&id=p43#p43))

Several specifications emerge:

1. **Continuity of consciousness**: "knowing even as we know now"—the subjective experience of identity persists through the death-resurrection transition
2. **Memory preservation**: "a bright recollection of all our guilt"—not merely survival but complete autobiographical memory
3. **Physical optimization**: "perfect form," "restored to its proper frame"—the resurrection body is not merely reassembled but improved

The framework suggests three distinct phases of embodiment:

1. **Pre-mortal spirit**: intelligence housed in a "spirit body" (a substrate capable of consciousness but not subject to mortality)
2. **Mortal body**: the testing phase, subject to death
3. **Resurrected/glorified body**: permanent, optimized physical form

This maps remarkably onto contemporary discussions of mind uploading and substrate-independent consciousness. The "spirit" functions as an intermediate storage medium—a way of preserving the pattern of consciousness while the physical body undergoes reconstruction. Death triggers a upload; resurrection constitutes download into upgraded hardware.

Doctrine and Covenants 93 suggests something like this explicitly: "The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy" ([D&C 93:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p33#p33)). The goal is not escape from materiality but permanent fusion of consciousness and optimized matter.

## VI. The Three Kingdoms: A Trust-Hierarchy for Immortals

Doctrine and Covenants 76, commonly called "The Vision," presents the most detailed LDS account of post-mortal existence. Rather than the binary heaven/hell of traditional Christianity, it describes three "degrees of glory": celestial, terrestrial, and telestial.

Read as organizational structure rather than mere reward/punishment, these kingdoms represent differentiated levels of trust and responsibility within the immortal civilization:

### Celestial: The Ruling Class

> They are they who are the church of the Firstborn. They are they into whose hands the Father has given all things—They are they who are priests and kings, who have received of his fulness, and of his glory... Wherefore, as it is written, they are gods, even the sons of God. ([D&C 76:54-58](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=p54-p58#p54))

The language is unmistakably governmental: "priests and kings," "given all things," "gods." The celestial kingdom is not a retirement community but a governing body. Its inhabitants have demonstrated through their mortal probation that they can be trusted with ultimate power.

> And he makes them equal in power, and in might, and in dominion. ([D&C 76:95](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=p95#p95))

This equality is striking: not a hierarchy under God but peers with God. The successful graduates of the testing program become full members of the divine civilization, possessing equivalent capabilities.

Doctrine and Covenants 132 specifies the reproductive dimension:

> Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them. ([D&C 132:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p20#p20))

The phrase "a continuation of the seeds forever and ever" ([D&C 132:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p19#p19)) indicates that celestial beings become world-builders themselves—parents of new civilizations, administrators of new testing environments. The cycle perpetuates.

### Terrestrial and Telestial: Subordinate Roles

The terrestrial and telestial kingdoms represent lesser degrees of trust. Their inhabitants receive immortality—the civilization provides for all its members—but they are not entrusted with creative and governing power. The terrestrial "receive of the presence of the Son, but not of the fulness of the Father" ([D&C 76:77](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=p77#p77)). The telestial receive neither in full measure but still eventually obtain a glory that "surpasses all understanding" ([D&C 76:89](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=p89#p89)).

This graduated system solves a problem that any immortal civilization must face: what do you do with members who have demonstrated unsuitability for power but whom you cannot (for ethical or practical reasons) simply eliminate? You provide for them, grant them meaningful existence, but limit their sphere of influence. The three kingdoms are an organizational solution, not merely a reward structure.

## VII. Theodicy Reconsidered: Evil as Necessary Test Condition

The classic problem of theodicy—why does a good and omnipotent God permit suffering?—has generated vast philosophical literature. The transhumanist reading of LDS cosmology suggests a radically different framing.

If the purpose of mortal existence is to test consciousnesses for trustworthiness with power, then certain conditions become necessary:

1. **Genuine agency**: The test must involve real choice with real consequences
2. **Hidden knowledge**: If the evaluators were constantly visible, the test would be compromised
3. **Adversity**: Response to suffering reveals character that comfort cannot
4. **Opposition**: There must be genuine alternatives, genuine temptations, genuine possibility of failure

This is not a theodicy that justifies suffering by reference to divine mystery or greater goods invisible to mortals. It is a frank acknowledgment that the testing conditions require difficulty. The question is not "why does God allow evil?" but "given that we are selecting for trustworthy immortals, what testing environment is optimal?"

The "veil of forgetfulness" that LDS doctrine places between pre-mortal and mortal existence becomes intelligible as a necessary testing protocol. If you remembered being in the council, remembered choosing to come, remembered the stakes—the test would be fundamentally different. The forgetting is not cruelty but experimental control.

## VIII. Implications and Conclusion

This reading does not claim to represent official LDS doctrine or to exhaust the meaning of these texts. Scripture, like all rich literature, sustains multiple interpretations. What this transhumanist reading offers is a framework for taking LDS cosmology seriously as speculative worldbuilding—as one possible answer to questions that technological civilization is only now learning to ask:

- How might consciousness be preserved beyond biological death?
- How should a civilization of immortals govern itself?
- What testing would you design to identify beings suitable for godlike power?
- How do you perpetuate a species across cosmic time?

The LDS scriptural corpus, whatever else it may be, constitutes an extraordinarily detailed answer to these questions. It imagines a material, embodied, progressive afterlife—not escape from the physical but its perfection. It imagines divinity not as wholly other but as developmental destination. It imagines the cosmos not as stage for human drama but as operational infrastructure for species perpetuation across billions of worlds and billions of years.

Perhaps most remarkably, it does all this in texts produced primarily between 1830 and 1844, decades before Darwin, a century before computers, and long before anyone spoke of transhumanism, the Fermi paradox, or the long-term survival of intelligent life.

Whether one reads these texts as revelation, as visionary speculation, or as remarkably prescient science fiction, they represent a singular contribution to humanity's ongoing conversation about what we might become and how we might ensure our continuation. In an era increasingly preoccupied with existential risk and the far future, the Latter-day Saint cosmological imagination offers resources that deserve serious attention from believers and non-believers alike.
