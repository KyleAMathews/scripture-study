# Phase 5: Determinate Negation — Structural Analysis

## Initial Synthesis Guess (to be compared against final output)

> The competence/blessedness pattern is neither "in the events" nor "merely in the text" — it exists in the encounter between a prophetically-trained mind and historical material, where construction and discovery are the same act.

## 5.0 Internal Tensions (Self-Sublation)

### Where Monk A Undermines Itself

**The D&C 9:8 problem.** Monk A's strongest theological move — that prophetic craft IS revelation via D&C 9:8 ("study it out in your mind; then ask me if it be right") — actually concedes Monk B's core insight. If the prophet's editorial labor is the *instrument* of revelation, then the pattern doesn't exist in the events independent of the prophetic seeing. Without Mormon's editorial craft, there is no visible pattern. The telescope analogy breaks down precisely here: a telescope reveals stars that exist whether or not anyone looks. But if the prophet's editorial craft is what makes the pattern visible — if the "studying it out" is constitutive, not just transmissive — then the pattern is produced through the encounter of prophetic mind and historical material. It doesn't sit in the events waiting to be found, like a fossil in rock. It emerges through the prophet's trained attention. This is much closer to Monk B's position than Monk A realizes.

**The cross-traditional convergence fallacy.** Monk A claims that the competence/blessedness pattern appearing independently in Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, and Christian traditions proves it's ontologically real — multiple independent witnesses observing the same phenomenon. But these traditions aren't observing *the same events*. They're theorizing about *the same theological problem*: how does divine power relate to human effort? Independent convergence on a theoretical question is categorically different from independent observation of the same natural phenomenon. Multiple cultures independently developing concepts of "justice" doesn't prove justice is a physical force in the universe; it proves justice is a fundamental human concern. Monk A conflates convergent theologizing with convergent empirical observation — and the distinction matters, because the former supports Monk B's view (this is how human minds think about God) as much as Monk A's (this is how God acts).

**The pedagogy self-defeat.** Monk A's "uncomfortable conclusion" — that God *deliberately withholds* miraculous intervention from competent people for pedagogical purposes, orchestrating contrasts to teach — actually makes God an editor. If God arranges history into paired contrasts for didactic purposes, then God is doing at the level of events precisely what Mormon does at the level of text: selecting, arranging, emphasizing to teach a lesson. Monk A's God is an editorial constructor of providential meaning. The gap between "God arranges events into teaching pairs" and "Mormon arranges narratives into teaching pairs" is narrower than Monk A wants it to be. The divine pedagogy Monk A describes is structurally identical to the editorial construction Monk B describes — just operating at a different scale.

**The Murphy exposure.** Monk A acknowledges Murphy's challenge (a patterned God is a domesticated God) but doesn't adequately address it. If the competence/blessedness pattern is *predictable* — if God reliably does X when humans are competent and Y when they're dependent — then God has been reduced to a function: given input (mode of human faith), output (mode of divine response). This is a character in a story, not a free Person. Monk A's own evidence actually shows more variety than the three-pair structure suggests (Nehemiah prays AND sets a watch; the stripling warriors fight WITH miraculous strength), but the essay doesn't leverage this variety against its own thesis of clean recurrence.

### Where Monk B Undermines Itself

**The selective agnosticism.** Monk B claims the gap between event and text is "unbridgeable" — we can never get behind Mormon's abridgment to the events themselves. But then Monk B confidently claims what the events did NOT look like: they were NOT symmetrical, NOT paired, NOT escalating. "History is not this tidy." This is a contradiction. If the gap is truly unbridgeable, you cannot claim the events lacked the pattern any more than you can claim they had it. Monk B's agnosticism is deployed selectively — agnostic when skepticism is convenient, confident when debunking is useful. True agnosticism about the events behind the text would produce genuine underdetermination, not confident denial.

**The "profound theology" concession.** Monk B says Mormon's theology is "extraordinary, profound, and deeply worth engaging" and "may even be *true* as theology." But if the theology is true — if competence and blessedness really are different modes of divine-human interaction, and grace really does complete what effort begins — then what makes the theology true? If the competence/blessedness distinction captures something real about how God relates to human beings, then Mormon's editorial craft *surfaced a real truth* through his constructive activity. Monk B cannot simultaneously affirm the theology's potential truth AND deny that the pattern reflects reality. A true theology of divine action *is* a claim about how God acts — which is precisely what Monk A argues. Monk B's concession that the theology might be true opens a door it cannot close.

**The Murphy boomerang.** Monk B deploys Murphy to argue that a patterned God is a domesticated God — but Murphy's argument, pushed to its extreme, doesn't just defeat Monk A. It defeats any theology of divine action whatsoever, including Monk B's own appreciation for Mormon's theological contribution. If God is so free that no patterns can describe divine action, then we cannot say *anything* about how God operates — not even that God works through prophets, or that God's grace is real, or that Mormon's theology is "profound." Murphy's critique is an acid that dissolves all theological claims, not just claims about recurrence. Monk B invokes Murphy surgically to attack Monk A while exempting itself from the blast radius. But you can't use radical divine freedom against your opponent's theology while simultaneously calling your opponent's theology "profound."

**The DH parallel backfires.** Monk B uses the Deuteronomistic History as a structural parallel — like the Deuteronomist, Mormon imposed an editorial framework on pre-existing sources. But scholarship on the DH actually demonstrates that editorial construction and historical reality are not mutually exclusive. Frank Moore Cross's double-redaction model shows multiple editorial layers, yet the underlying observation — that Israel repeatedly failed covenant fidelity — is widely accepted as historically genuine. The editorial framework *amplified and stylized* a real dynamic. If this is true of the DH (and Monk B accepts that it is), then the same could be true of Mormon — editorial construction surfacing a genuine historical pattern. Monk B's best historical parallel actually supports a both/and conclusion, not the either/or it needs.

## 5.1 Surface Contradiction

Monk A says: The competence/blessedness pattern is in the events — God's constant character produces recognizable patterns of action, and Mormon's prophetic sight perceives what is genuinely there.

Monk B says: The pattern is in the text — Mormon's editorial craft (selection, arrangement, phrasing, structural matching) constructs the appearance of a pattern from source material that was far messier and more ambiguous than the finished product suggests.

The apparent argument is about *location*: does the pattern live in history or in the narrative about history?

---

## 5.2 Shared Assumptions

Both monks share assumptions they don't realize they share. These shared assumptions are where the real limitation lives.

**1. The event/text binary.** Both assume a sharp distinction between "events" (what happened) and "text" (what was written about what happened). Both treat the relationship as one of correspondence — the text either faithfully captures events (Monk A) or constructively reshapes them (Monk B). Neither considers that events themselves are always already interpreted by their participants. There is no "raw event" independent of some framework of meaning. Limhi's people experienced their escape *as* a clever plan; Alma's people experienced their deliverance *as* divine intervention. The meaning was in the experience, not added later by an editor. The event/text binary assumes a neutral, meaningless "event" that editors then endow with significance. But human events are never meaningless — they are always experienced through frameworks of interpretation, especially by communities of faith.

**2. Construction and discovery are opposites.** This is the deepest shared assumption. Both monks accept that showing editorial construction is a *challenge* to ontological reality. Monk A works hard to argue that craft doesn't undermine truth; Monk B argues that craft demonstrates construction. But both accept the premise that these are in tension — that to the extent something is constructed, it is less discovered, and vice versa. Neither considers the possibility that construction and discovery might be the same act — that the prophetic editor's constructive activity might be precisely how genuine patterns in sacred history become visible.

**3. "The pattern" is a single discrete thing.** Both argue about whether one pattern (competence/blessedness, three pairs, escalating) is real or constructed. Neither questions whether decomposing this into a single binary pattern is the right move. The actual texture of the narratives is richer than either monk acknowledges: Nehemiah integrates both modes simultaneously; the stripling warriors fight with competence AND miraculous strength; Alma₁ later preaches to Limhi's people that God was present in their "competent" escape too. The three-pair structure is Mormon's organization of a more complex reality — and the question of whether *that organization* is real or constructed is different from whether the *underlying complexity of divine action* is real.

**4. The implied reader is modern-critical.** Both monks argue as if the question is decidable by textual analysis — editorial seams prove construction (Monk B) or editorial craft proves prophetic revelation (Monk A). Neither considers that for the communities who received these texts, the question would not have arisen in this form. The Nephites who heard Mormon's abridgment, the Israelites who heard the Deuteronomistic History, didn't have access to "the events behind the text" any more than we do. The text *was* their access to sacred history. The modern critical distinction between event and narrative is a product of Enlightenment epistemology, not a feature of the texts' original reception.

## 5.3 Determinate Negation

**Monk A fails because:** Its claim that prophetic craft IS revelation actually dissolves the very distinction it needs — between "in the events" and "in the text." If D&C 9:8 is right that revelation works through intellectual labor, then the pattern doesn't exist "in the events" waiting to be passively discovered. It comes into existence through the prophet's active engagement with historical material. Monk A wants the pattern to be OUT THERE, objective, independent of the seeing. But its own best theology of revelation says the seeing is constitutive. **This failure reveals:** the need for an epistemological category where the prophet's constructive activity and the reality it discloses are not in competition — where "finding" and "making" are the same operation.

**Monk B fails because:** Its confidence that the pattern is "merely" editorial construction rests on an unstated assumption that editorial construction cannot disclose reality. Monk B never justifies this assumption — and its own concession that Mormon's theology might be "true" implicitly refutes it. If a theology produced through editorial construction can be *true*, then editorial construction is truth-disclosing, not truth-obscuring. Monk B's position, fully pressed, would mean no historical narrative can ever tell us anything about the world it describes — only about the editor who shaped it. No one actually believes this. **This failure reveals:** the need for an account of how constructed narratives can genuinely disclose features of reality that are not accessible without the construction.

The failures are complementary: Monk A needs construction to be truth-disclosing but won't admit how much construction is happening. Monk B sees the construction clearly but won't admit it can disclose truth. Each monk's blind spot is what the other can partially see.

## 5.4 The Hidden Question

Both monks ask: **"Is the pattern in the events or in the text?"**

The hidden question is: **"Is there a mode of knowing in which construction and discovery are the same act — and is prophetic editorial craft an instance of it?"**

This reframes the debate entirely. The question is not about where the pattern lives (in events vs. in text) but about *what kind of knowledge prophetic historiography produces and what its relationship to reality is.*

If such a mode exists — if construction can be simultaneously disclosive — then the entire competence/blessedness debate transforms. Hardy's evidence of editorial craft becomes evidence not of fabrication but of *prophetic perception at work*. And the pattern's theological truth becomes inseparable from (not despite) its editorial construction.

## 5.5 Boydian Decomposition

### The Generic Space

Both positions share an abstract structure: **observation → representation → question of fidelity.** Something happened (events). Someone represented it (text). We ask: how faithful? This observation-representation-fidelity structure is the skeleton both monks build on. The synthesis may need to transcend this structure entirely — replacing "fidelity of representation" with a different account of what prophetic texts do.

### Atomic Components (stripped from positions, unstructured)

- Divine constancy produces recognizable character traits in God's action (A)
- Prophetic craft is the instrument of revelation, not its competitor (A, D&C 9:8)
- Double agency means divine and human causation don't compete (A, Farrer)
- Cross-traditional convergence on competence/blessedness (A)
- The Gideon principle: God deliberately reduces human resources (A)
- Editorial selection from vast archives can produce any pattern (B)
- Hardy's editorial seams are real: shared phrases, matched blocks, strategic dampening (B)
- Emplotment is always imposed — events don't dictate their story shape (B, White)
- Patterned God is domesticated God (B, Murphy)
- Art and historiography are inseparable in biblical narrative (B cites Sternberg but doesn't follow through)
- Mormon's theology might be genuinely true (B, concession)
- The event-text gap means the pattern's ontological status is underdetermined (B)
- Alma₁ tells Limhi's people God was in their escape too — blurring the competence/blessedness line (briefing)
- Nehemiah integrates both modes simultaneously (briefing)
- Stripling warriors fight with competence AND miraculous strength (briefing)
- "Thus we see" claims to extract, not impose (A)
- Six-verse treatment of a conflict that doesn't serve the pattern (B)

### Surprising Cross-Domain Connections

**1. Monk A's "prophetic craft IS revelation" + Monk B's "what we learn is theology" → Same phenomenon, different valuations.** If prophetic craft is revelation (A), then what we learn through the craft IS theological truth (B). Monk A calls this "ontological reality;" Monk B calls this "editorial construction." But they're describing the same thing: a prophetically-trained mind encountering historical material and producing theological knowledge. The disagreement is about the *epistemic status* of that knowledge, not its content or process.

**2. Monk A's "God as pedagogue" + Monk B's "Mormon as editor" → Structural identity.** If God arranges competence/blessedness contrasts to teach (Monk A's Gideon principle), then God is doing at the level of events what Mormon does at the level of text. God-as-pedagogue IS an editorial constructor. Monk A has accidentally theologized Monk B's position: the editorial construction of meaning from raw material is what God does. This means editorial construction is not the *alternative* to divine action — it's the *image* of divine action. Mormon's craft mirrors God's craft. The prophet edits history because God "edits" history.

**3. Farrer's double agency + White's emplotment → Dissolution of the binary.** If every act is simultaneously divine and human (Farrer), then every act of emplotment is simultaneously construction and disclosure. White is right that emplotment is always human. Farrer says human acts are always also divine. Combine them: editorial construction IS divine disclosure — not despite being construction but through being construction. This isn't compromise; it's a new category that neither monk can generate from within their own framework.

**4. Murphy's "God is not a story" + the actual textual evidence → Character, not formula.** Murphy is right that a perfectly patterned God is a literary character, not a free Person. But the actual evidence shows God DOESN'T follow a clean formula. Sometimes competence works fine (Nehemiah). Sometimes miracles come without any competence/blessedness contrast (Pentecost). Sometimes both operate simultaneously (stripling warriors). Sometimes God blurs his own pattern (Alma₁ preaching to Limhi's people that God was in their escape too). The "pattern" is more like a *divine character trait* — a tendency, a preference, a recurring way of being — that manifests differently in different contexts. Like a person whose character is recognizable across situations without being formulaic. This is character, not algorithm. And character is what free persons have.

### Adjacent Domain Material

**Michael Polanyi's "personal knowledge."** Polanyi argued that scientific discovery involves a "personal coefficient" — the scientist's trained intuition that guides what they notice and how they interpret it. Discovery is not passive reception of neutral facts; it involves the scientist's trained subjectivity. Yet the knowledge produced is genuine — not "merely subjective." The prophetic editor's craft is analogous: a trained subjectivity that produces genuine knowledge *precisely through* its constructive activity. You can't separate what Polanyi's scientist "discovers" from the training and intuition that led them to look in the right place. The claim that training-dependent perception is "merely constructed" would destroy science along with prophecy.

**Gadamer's hermeneutical tradition.** Prejudice (*Vorurteil* — pre-judgment) is not the enemy of understanding but its condition. You can only understand something from within a tradition, using categories that tradition provides. Mormon's theological categories (competence vs. blessedness, divine constancy, the Gideon principle) are his tradition's pre-judgments — and they are what allow him to see what's there in the historical material. Without them, a thousand years of data would be meaningless noise. The categories are simultaneously constructive (they organize the field of vision) AND disclosive (they make real features of the data visible). Tradition-dependent perception is not defective perception; it's the only kind there is.

**Expert perception in cognitive science.** The chess grandmaster who "sees" winning positions, the radiologist who "sees" tumors, the master naturalist who "sees" species — all are exercising a trained perception that is simultaneously constructive and disclosive. The grandmaster's chess training *constructs* how they see the board AND *reveals* what's genuinely there. The untrained eye sees pieces; the trained eye sees structure. The structure is real — it can be verified, it predicts outcomes — but it's only visible to trained perception. Mormon's prophetic editorial craft may work the same way: his theological training constructs how he sees sacred history AND reveals genuine patterns that untrained reading would miss.

## 5.6 Sublation Criteria

The synthesis must:

1. **Preserve Monk A's insight** that the competence/blessedness pattern reflects something genuinely real about divine-human interaction — not just editorial preference but actual theological truth about how God works with human beings.

2. **Preserve Monk B's insight** that editorial craft is comprehensive, genuine, and constitutive — Hardy's evidence of Mormon's editorial construction is real and important, not something to be explained away or minimized.

3. **Dissolve the shared assumption** that construction and discovery are competing explanations — that showing editorial craft challenges ontological reality, or that affirming reality requires minimizing craft.

4. **Answer the hidden question** about whether prophetic editorial craft is a mode of knowing in which construction and discovery are the same act.

5. **Engage Murphy's challenge** without either domesticating God (reducing God to a formula) or making God epistemically inaccessible (denying all patterns in divine action).

6. **Have the closure property**: be concrete enough that a monk could believe it at full conviction in the next round and argue from it.
