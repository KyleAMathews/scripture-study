# The Pattern Lives in the Text: Why Competence/Blessedness Is Editorial Construction

The competence/blessedness pattern that Grant Hardy identifies across Mormon's editorial work in the Book of Mormon is not a window onto how God operates in history. It is a window onto how Mormon operates on history. It is a theological lens — a hermeneutical framework that a prophet-editor brings to his sources, shaping a millennium of raw, contradictory, messy human experience into a symmetrical, escalating, three-paired structure that teaches exactly what Mormon wants it to teach. The pattern lives in the text. It does not live in the events behind the text.

Let me be precise about what I am claiming and what I am not. I am not claiming Mormon fabricated his sources. I am not claiming the Book of Mormon is fiction. I am not even claiming Mormon was insincere. Mormon was a prophet and a historian, and like all prophet-historians — like the Deuteronomist who shaped Joshua through Kings, like Luke who paralleled Jesus' journey to Jerusalem with Paul's journey to Rome, like Thucydides who structured the Peloponnesian War as two mirror-image decades — he exercised editorial craft so comprehensive, so systematic, and so theologically controlled that the resulting patterns tell us about the editor's theology, not about the structure of divine action itself.

## What the Pattern Actually Is

Hardy shows that Mormon constructs three paired narratives across roughly 200 pages of text: Limhi's escape versus Alma's deliverance, Alma the Younger's preaching tour versus the sons of Mosiah's mission, Captain Moroni's military campaigns versus Helaman's stripling warriors. In every pair, the first narrative features faithful people using human competence — cleverness, professional skill, institutional authority — to accomplish righteous ends. The second features faithful people trusting beyond their abilities and receiving miraculous divine intervention. In every pair, Mormon tells the miraculous tale second, gives it more dramatic weight, links it forward to the next pair, and dampens the competence narrative through strategic emphasis.

This is not a pattern that emerges from reading the text naively. It is a pattern that emerges from Hardy's careful analysis of Mormon's editorial seams: the shared distinctive phrases manufactured to create the sense of parallel ("gathered their flocks," "departed into the wilderness"), the matching block lengths imposed on stories covering vastly different time periods (two years compressed to match fourteen), the strategic foregrounding of Alma's failure at Ammonihah to undercut his otherwise substantial success, the insertion of a tribute to Moroni ("if all men had been like unto Moroni...") at a moment that does not match the surrounding evidence, the reduction of a generation-long conflict to six verses because it does not serve the pattern. These are the fingerprints of an editor at work. They are not the fingerprints of God.

## The Strongest Case for Ontological Reality — and Why It Fails

The strongest version of the opposing argument runs as follows: Mormon is constrained by sources he did not create. The events happened before he was born. He cannot freely invent parallels — he can only find them. And the pattern he finds appears not just in one tradition but across many: Gideon's deliberately reduced army, David rejecting Saul's armor, Jericho falling by trumpet while Ai falls by ambush, the jiriki/tariki distinction in Buddhism, the cat-and-monkey schools of Vaishnavism. If the same tension between competence and blessedness surfaces independently in every major religious tradition, that universality argues for ontological reality. A constant God should produce recognizable patterns. Mormon found what was there.

Here is why this fails at the structural level.

The universality of the pattern is evidence *for* construction, not against it. The competence/blessedness tension appears in every tradition precisely because it is a fundamental feature of how religious communities organize experience — not a fundamental feature of how God organizes history. Hayden White demonstrated that historians do not transcribe the shape of events; they impose narrative structure through emplotment. "No events are intrinsically tragic." A sequence of events can be narrated as tragedy, comedy, romance, or satire, and there is no way of proving that one of these is the correct form. The events do not dictate their own story shape. The historian chooses. And the historian's choice is determined not by the events but by deep tropological commitments — metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, irony — that prefigure the historical field before a single fact is recorded.

Mormon's tropological commitment is clear: he reads history through a theology of divine sufficiency. Weakness is designed. Human competence serves God's purposes but cannot replace God's power. Grace completes what effort begins. This is a profound theology. It may even be *true* as theology. But it is a lens applied to history, not a structure discovered in history. The fact that Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, and Christian thinkers all independently construct the same tension proves that the human mind gravitates toward this particular binary when it contemplates the relationship between effort and grace — not that reality is structured around it.

The claim that "Mormon is constrained by sources" is true but irrelevant. Every editor is constrained by sources. The Deuteronomist who shaped Joshua through Kings was constrained by pre-existing tribal hero stories — Ehud's cunning assassination, Samson's superhuman feats, Deborah's military leadership. These stories existed before the redactor touched them. But the redactor imposed a cyclical framework — apostasy, oppression, repentance, deliverance — that scholars have identified through the formulaic repetition of "the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord" (Judges 3:7, 3:12, 4:1, 10:6, 13:1). The formula is the editor's, not the event's. The cycle is the editor's theology, not history's structure. Martin Noth demonstrated this in his foundational analysis: a single Deuteronomistic author working in the exilic period shaped centuries of disparate tribal traditions into a unified theological narrative that explained national catastrophe as covenant infidelity. The individual stories were real. The cycle imposed on them was constructed. Mormon's situation is structurally identical.

## The Editorial Controls Are Too Comprehensive

Consider what Hardy actually demonstrates. Mormon does not merely select stories that happen to illustrate his theme. He actively shapes the reader's experience of those stories through a suite of editorial techniques: matching block lengths across stories of vastly different scale, inserting shared vocabulary to manufacture parallels, strategically dampening one narrative's success while amplifying another's miracles, placing tributes at moments calculated for maximum thematic effect rather than maximum historical accuracy, compressing or expanding temporal coverage based on thematic utility rather than historical proportion.

This is not a historian discovering patterns. This is an editor constructing them. The three-pair structure — with its escalating symmetry, its consistent placement of the miraculous second, its linking thread where each blessed narrative seeds the next pair — is too symmetrical, too consistent, too editorially controlled to be the raw shape of a thousand years of independent events. History is not this tidy. History does not arrange itself into matched pairs with escalating dramatic weight and forward-linking narrative threads across two hundred pages. Only editors do that.

And this is where Francesca Murphy's critique becomes devastating — not to my position, but to my opponent's. Murphy argues in *God is Not a Story* that reducing God's action to narrative patterns domesticates divine freedom. If God is truly free, truly personal, truly mysterious, then God's actions cannot be captured in predictable recurring structures. The very concept of "providential recurrence" — that God reliably does the same kind of thing in the same kind of situation — turns the living God into a character bound by genre conventions. The competence/blessedness pattern, if taken as ontologically real, makes God a literary device in his own story: predictable, symmetrical, tidily escalating. Murphy would say that a God reduced to pattern is no longer God. The Persons of the Trinity lose, as she puts it, "their free, unpredictable and self-governed personhood." I agree. The pattern is Mormon's theology. God is freer than the pattern.

## The Uncomfortable Conclusion

If the competence/blessedness pattern is editorial construction, what does that mean for all scriptural patterns? The answer is: the same thing. The Deuteronomistic cycles are constructed. Paul's Adam/Christ typology is constructed. Luke's Jesus-Paul parallels are constructed. The Gospel writers' divergent arrangements of the same events are four constructions of meaning from one set of occurrences. Every text we have passed through human hands that selected, arranged, emphasized, and omitted. We have never had unmediated access to "what God did." We have always had access to what a prophet-editor decided to tell us about what God did, shaped by that editor's theological commitments, literary conventions, rhetorical goals, and available sources.

This does not dissolve the concept of learning from scripture. It relocates what we learn. We learn Mormon's theology — which is extraordinary, profound, and deeply worth engaging. We learn how a prophetic mind organizes the overwhelming complexity of a thousand years into a coherent account of God's dealings with humanity. We learn what Mormon believed about competence and grace, and his beliefs may illuminate something genuinely true about the divine-human relationship. But we learn it as theology, not as history. We learn it as the product of a mind encountering God and constructing meaning from that encounter — not as a transparent report of how God structured the events themselves.

What we never learn — what we *cannot* learn from any edited text — is whether the events themselves, in their raw unmediated complexity, actually exhibited the pattern the editor constructed. That information is permanently inaccessible. Mormon had the large plates. We have Mormon's abridgment. The abridgment is brilliant. It is theologically generative. It may be inspired. But it is an abridgment — which means it is a construction.

## The Load-Bearing Premises

My argument depends on three structural premises. If any of them falls, the argument collapses.

First: *editorial selection from a vast archive is sufficient to produce any desired pattern.* Mormon had a millennium of material. Given that much data, any theological lens applied consistently will find confirming instances. This is the base-rate problem. The question is not whether examples of competence and blessedness exist in Nephite history — of course they do. The question is whether the *specific symmetrical three-paired escalating structure* exists in the events or only in the selection. My claim is that the selection is doing the work.

Second: *Hardy's editorial seams are real.* If the shared vocabulary, matched block lengths, strategic dampening, and thematic tributes are genuine features of the text — and Hardy's analysis is meticulous — then we have direct evidence of editorial construction. The seams prove the garment was sewn, not grown.

Third: *the gap between event and text is unbridgeable for edited historical narrative.* We cannot get behind Mormon's abridgment to the events themselves. We cannot check his pattern against the raw data. This means the pattern's ontological status is permanently underdetermined — and in conditions of underdetermination, the simpler explanation (editorial construction) should be preferred over the metaphysically extravagant one (God reliably structures history into matched symmetrical pairs).

This is what I believe: Mormon was a prophet, a theologian, and an artist. His editorial craft is the medium through which his theology reaches us. The competence/blessedness pattern is his theology made visible — a profound, coherent, spiritually generative account of how divine grace relates to human effort. But it is *his* account. It is not the shape of history. It is the shape of a mind encountering history and making it mean something. That is what all scripture is. That is what all history is. The editor's art is the only access we have. And mistaking the art for the world is the foundational error of anyone who claims the pattern is ontologically real.
