# Round 2: Determinate Negation + Sublation

## Initial Synthesis Guess

> The competence/blessedness binary is itself too shallow — the scriptures reveal not two modes but an irreducible repertoire of divine modes of engaging human agency, and God's character is the repertoire, not any single mode within it.

---

## 5.0 Internal Tensions

### Where Monk A Undermines Itself

Monk A sets out to prove the competence/blessedness pattern is everywhere. The essay delivers — story after story, dispensation after dispensation. But in proving ubiquity, Monk A inadvertently demonstrates that the "pattern" stretches so wide it stops being a pattern. Consider what Monk A's own examples actually show:

- **Enoch/Moses**: weakness → miraculous power (pure blessedness)
- **Abraham on Moriah**: surrender beyond reason → divine provision (pure blessedness)
- **Red Sea**: "stand still" — human agency entirely replaced
- **Gideon**: resources deliberately stripped
- **David**: competent means rejected in favor of humble means
- **Brother of Jared**: human solution required, then divinely transfigured
- **Oliver Cowdery**: pure blessedness FAILS — you must study first
- **Nephi's ship**: divine instruction + real carpentry

These are not the same pattern. "Stand still and see" (Red Sea) is the opposite of "study it out in your mind" (D&C 9:8). God *stripping away* resources (Gideon) is different from God *requiring* a human solution (brother of Jared). Nephi doing real carpentry with divine blueprints is different from Peter walking on water through pure faith. Monk A calls all of these "competence/blessedness" but they're actually several different modes of divine-human interaction that the binary conflates.

The argument from ubiquity defeats itself: if the pattern is everywhere, it's either so vague as to mean nothing ("God sometimes works through human skill and sometimes works miraculously" — trivially true) or it's actually several distinct patterns being forced into one binary.

### Where Monk B Undermines Itself

Monk B's five categories of counter-evidence are devastating — but they accidentally reveal structure where Monk B claims to find only mess. Look at the categories:

1. Competence AS miracle (Bezalel, Daniel)
2. Blessedness that fails (Abinadi, Hebrews 11)
3. Integration (Joseph, Nehemiah)
4. Off-axis entirely (Creation, covenant, still small voice)
5. Competence without contrast (Proverbs, Talents, D&C 58)

These aren't random counter-examples. They're *distinct modes of divine engagement with human agency.* Each category has its own internal logic, its own scriptural examples, its own theological implications. Monk B finds five categories, calls them "mess," and concludes the binary is broken. But five coherent categories aren't mess — they're a richer taxonomy. Monk B has accidentally discovered the structure it denies exists.

The D&C 58 point is particularly telling. Monk B deploys it as counter-evidence against blessedness-as-primary. But D&C 58 doesn't say "there is no divine involvement." It says "the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves." The power is *in them* — put there by God. This is a distinct mode of divine action: God *deferring to* human agency, building capacity rather than intervening. It's not the absence of divine engagement; it's a specific form of it.

---

## 5.1 Surface Contradiction (Round 2)

Monk A: The competence/blessedness pattern is pervasive across all scripture — it's THE signature of God's character.

Monk B: The scriptures are messier than the binary allows — it's A pattern, not THE pattern.

## 5.2 Shared Assumptions

**Both still assume the binary is the right unit of analysis.** Monk A tries to find it everywhere. Monk B tries to show it doesn't fit. But both are arguing about WHETHER the competence/blessedness binary is central. Neither asks whether the binary itself is the right lens.

**Both assume divine action should be classifiable into modes at all.** Monk A classifies everything as competence-or-blessedness. Monk B introduces more categories but still classifies. Neither fully reckons with the possibility that the irreducible variety is the point — that God's personhood is expressed through a repertoire that resists any single frame.

## 5.3 Determinate Negation

**Monk A fails because:** Proving the pattern is everywhere requires stretching "competence vs. blessedness" until it covers situations that are genuinely different from each other. "Stand still and see" (Red Sea) and "study it out in your mind" (D&C 9:8) are not the same pattern. God stripping away resources (Gideon) and God requiring a human contribution to transfigure (brother of Jared) are not the same pattern. The ubiquity argument works only if the pattern is defined so loosely that it loses analytical power. **This reveals:** the binary is too coarse-grained. The actual territory has more structure than two poles.

**Monk B fails because:** Cataloging counter-evidence produces not mess but a richer taxonomy — five coherent categories that each represent a distinct mode of divine engagement. Monk B reads diversity as chaos when it's actually a repertoire. **This reveals:** the scriptures aren't formless — they display a *plurality* of modes rather than a binary, and that plurality has structure.

## 5.4 The Hidden Question

Round 2's hidden question: **Not "is the binary central or peripheral?" but "what is the actual taxonomy of how God engages human agency, and what does the irreducible plurality of modes reveal about God's character?"**

If competence/blessedness is one mode among several, and each mode has its own logic, its own scriptural home, and its own theological implications — then the real question is: what does the *repertoire itself* tell us about who God is?

## 5.5 Boydian Decomposition

### Atomic Components (stripped from both positions)

From both monks' scriptural evidence, here are the distinct modes of divine engagement with human agency that actually appear in the standard works:

1. **Replace**: God acts alone; humans stand still. (Red Sea, Jericho walls, Alma₁'s deliverance)
2. **Strip**: God deliberately reduces human resources to make divine action legible. (Gideon's 300, David's sling, Elijah's wet altar, Ether 12:27)
3. **Enhance**: The Spirit manifests as supernaturally heightened skill. (Bezalel's craftsmanship, Daniel's learning, Pentecost's languages)
4. **Instruct**: God provides the blueprint; humans execute with real labor. (Nephi's ship, brother of Jared's stones, Noah's ark)
5. **Integrate**: Competence and divine favor seamlessly entangled, inseparable. (Joseph in Egypt, Nehemiah, Alma 17:2-3's prepared missionaries)
6. **Defer**: God builds capacity in humans and tells them to act on their own initiative. (D&C 58:26-28, Proverbs, Parable of Talents)
7. **Withdraw**: Faithful dependence does not produce deliverance; suffering is the gift. (Abinadi, Ammonihah believers, Hebrews 11:35-39, Job, Liberty Jail)
8. **Presence**: God shows up not through mode of action but through mode of being-with. (Still small voice, burning bush, temple worship, sacrament)

### The Surprising Connection

These eight modes aren't random. They form a spectrum defined by **how much of the action's authorship is legibly divine** — from fully visible divine authorship (Replace) to fully hidden divine authorship (Defer) to divine authorship expressed as presence rather than action at all (Presence).

And crucially: **the Gideon/Strip mode — which is what Hardy's competence/blessedness binary isolates — is the mode specifically concerned with MAKING divine authorship legible.** God reduces the army from 32,000 to 300 "lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me." The stated purpose is epistemic: ensuring the audience can't attribute the outcome to human competence. This is God's self-disclosure program — deliberately constructing situations where His role is unmistakable.

Mormon, as a prophetic editor tasked with making "the hand of God manifest" (Hardy's phrase), would naturally foreground this mode. Not because it's the only mode, but because it's the mode most aligned with his editorial mission. A prophet whose job is to make God visible in history will naturally emphasize the instances where God makes Himself visible.

### Adjacent Domain: The Artist's Repertoire

A great musician doesn't have one mode. They have a repertoire — fortissimo and pianissimo, staccato and legato, melody and silence. The character of the musician is expressed through the *range and selection* of modes, not through any single mode. You recognize Coltrane not because he always plays the same way but because his way of moving between modes — his choices about when to explode and when to whisper — is distinctively his.

If God is a Person (not a function), then divine character should be expressed the same way: through a repertoire of modes, where the selection among modes is a free personal act. The Gideon mode (Strip) reveals one aspect of that character — the pedagogy of dependence. The Bezalel mode (Enhance) reveals another — the dignity of human craft as vehicle of Spirit. The Job mode (Withdraw) reveals another — the sovereignty that refuses to be reduced to formula. The D&C 58 mode (Defer) reveals another — the God who builds capacity in His children and steps back.

No single mode is "the" pattern. The repertoire IS the character.

# Phase 6: Sublation — Round 2

## The Synthesis: The Divine Repertoire

### The Reconceptualization

The competence/blessedness binary is not wrong — it's shallow. It isolates one contrast (human skill vs. divine intervention) from a much richer spectrum of how God engages human agency. The scriptures do not portray a God who oscillates between two modes. They portray a God who works through an irreducible repertoire of at least eight distinct modes — replacing, stripping, enhancing, instructing, integrating, deferring, withdrawing, and being present — and whose character is expressed through the repertoire as a whole, not through any individual mode within it.

### What Gets Cancelled

**Monk A's claim that the competence/blessedness binary is THE signature of God's character.** It's one mode — the Strip/Replace cluster — foregrounded by an editor whose prophetic mission was to make divine action legible. Mormon emphasized the Gideon pattern because making God visible in history was his editorial vocation. But this emphasis, no matter how theologically important, is a curated selection from a much fuller repertoire.

**Monk B's claim that the scriptures are just "messy."** Monk B's five categories of counter-evidence are not chaos — they're the structure of the repertoire. The diversity is not formlessness; it's richness. God's action has structure — just more structure than a binary can contain.

### What Gets Preserved

**From Monk A:** The Gideon/Strip mode IS genuinely real and IS central to God's self-disclosure program. When God reduces the army, strips off the armor, gives men weakness — this is a real, recurring, cross-traditional divine pedagogy. It's not Mormon's invention. Multiple independent authors identify it because it is there to be identified. Mormon's editorial genius was to isolate and dramatize it with extraordinary clarity.

**From Monk B:** The scriptures portray a richer picture than the binary admits. Bezalel's Spirit-as-skill, Abinadi's unrewarded faithfulness, Joseph's seamlessly integrated favor, D&C 58's deferred agency, the still small voice's non-interventionist presence — these are not counter-evidence against pattern. They ARE the pattern, rightly conceived. The pattern is the repertoire.

### What Gets Elevated

**The concept of divine repertoire** — God's character expressed through an irreducible plurality of modes of engaging human agency, where:

1. Each mode has its own internal logic, its own scriptural home, and its own theological implications
2. The selection among modes is a free personal act that cannot be predicted from the human situation — this is where Murphy's "divine freedom" lives, not in the absence of character but in the *breadth* of character
3. The repertoire as a whole reveals more about God than any single mode — the way a person's character is revealed through the range of their responses across different situations, not through one response repeated
4. Mormon's editorial emphasis on the Strip/Replace cluster was genuine prophetic perception of one crucial mode — but prophetic perception is always partial (1 Corinthians 13:12: "now I see through a glass, darkly"), and the fuller picture requires the testimony of multiple prophets seeing different modes

This answers the Round 1 new contradiction about Murphy: a God with a rich repertoire of responses is neither domesticated (predictable, formulaic) nor epistemically inaccessible (so free that nothing can be said about divine action). A God with a repertoire is *personal* — recognizable across situations but not reducible to any formula. Like knowing a friend: you can recognize their handwriting, their sense of humor, their way of responding to difficulty — but you cannot *predict* exactly what they'll do, because they're a person, not a function.

### The Scriptural Map

| Mode | Logic | Key Texts | What It Reveals About God |
|------|-------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Replace** | God acts alone; humans stand still | Red Sea, Jericho, Alma₁'s deliverance | Sovereignty — God can act unilaterally |
| **Strip** | God reduces human resources to make divine action visible | Gideon, David, Ether 12:27 | Pedagogy — God teaches dependence by design |
| **Enhance** | Spirit manifests as supernaturally heightened skill | Bezalel, Daniel, Pentecost | Dignity — human craft can be Spirit-filled |
| **Instruct** | God provides blueprint; humans execute | Nephi's ship, brother of Jared, Noah | Collaboration — God and humans co-create |
| **Integrate** | Competence and favor seamlessly entangled | Joseph in Egypt, Nehemiah, Alma 17:2-3 | Immanence — God works invisibly within the ordinary |
| **Defer** | God builds capacity and tells humans to act | D&C 58, Proverbs, Parable of Talents | Trust — God believes in human agency |
| **Withdraw** | Faithful dependence does not produce deliverance | Abinadi, Job, Liberty Jail, Hebrews 11:35-39 | Mystery — God's purposes transcend outcomes |
| **Presence** | God shows up as being-with, not acting-upon | Still small voice, burning bush, sacrament | Intimacy — God offers Himself, not just results |

Hardy's competence/blessedness binary isolates the **Replace/Strip** cluster and contrasts it with **Integrate/Defer**. This is one valid cross-section of the repertoire. But it's a cross-section, not the whole.

### Abduction Test

If someone heard "God engages human agency through an irreducible repertoire of modes, and divine character is the repertoire" first, would they predict the monks?

Yes:
- They'd predict a monk who isolates one mode (Strip/Replace) and calls it THE pattern — because editors naturally foreground the most dramatic contrast, and the Gideon mode IS the most theologically explicit
- They'd predict a monk who catalogues counter-evidence showing the binary doesn't fit — because the repertoire is genuinely richer than any binary
- They'd predict both monks being *right about what they see* and wrong about what they claim from it

The original contradiction becomes predictable: of course people fight about whether the binary is central, because the binary isolates a real mode that is *particularly legible* (it's the mode designed for legibility!) while the rest of the repertoire is quieter, more integrated, less dramatic.

**Abduction type:** (b)/(c) boundary — introducing the concept of "divine repertoire" as a new structural principle for reading scriptural patterns, while drawing the specific modes from the monks' evidence. The taxonomy is emergent — neither monk proposed it or could have proposed it from within their frame.

### Validation Test

**Monk A should say:** "Yes, this preserves my core insight that the Gideon/Strip mode is genuinely real and cross-traditional. But I was wrong to claim it as THE pattern. I was trapped in treating one mode as the whole character. I now see Mormon's editorial emphasis as genuine prophetic perception of one mode — brilliant, true, and partial."

**Monk B should say:** "Yes, this preserves my insight that the scriptures are richer than the binary. But I was wrong to call that richness 'mess.' My five categories of counter-evidence were actually five modes of a repertoire I didn't recognize I was mapping. The scriptures have more structure than I admitted — just different structure than the binary."

### New Contradictions

1. **The selection problem.** If God freely selects among modes, what determines the selection? Is there any pattern to *which* mode God uses when? Or is selection irreducibly personal — meaning scriptural patterns can never yield predictive theology, only retrospective recognition?

2. **The prophetic partiality problem.** If each prophet perceives one mode most clearly (Mormon sees Strip, the Proverbs sage sees Defer, Job's poet sees Withdraw), then is the *whole* repertoire visible only to someone who reads all of them together? Does this make the canon itself — the collection of partial prophetic perceptions — the real locus of revelation, not any individual book?

3. **The Withdraw mode's challenge to the whole framework.** Abinadi and Job suggest God sometimes acts in ways that resist ALL modes of human understanding — not Replace, not Strip, not Enhance, but *withdraw from intelligibility entirely.* If the repertoire includes a mode where God refuses to be legible, then the concept of "divine repertoire" itself may be too tidy. Even the richer taxonomy may need an escape hatch for radical divine freedom.

### Hardy's Six Stories Mapped to the Repertoire

Mapping all six of Hardy's paired narratives onto the eight-mode taxonomy reveals that the stories don't sort cleanly into two bins:

**Pair 1: Limhi's Escape vs. Alma₁'s Deliverance**

| Story | Apparent Mode | But Actually... |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Limhi** (Mosiah 22) | **Defer** — God is never mentioned. Gideon devises a clever plan (wine for guards, slip out). Pure human ingenuity. | But Alma₁ later preaches to Limhi's people that "it was the Lord that did deliver them" — suggesting **Integrate** (God invisibly present in what looked like pure competence). Mormon himself softens the binary. |
| **Alma₁** (Mosiah 23-24) | **Replace** — God causes deep sleep on the Lamanites, they walk out with zero interference. | Clean fit. But note: God first *lightens their burdens* (a partial, sustaining intervention) before the full miraculous deliverance. The sequence is Presence → Replace, not just Replace. |

**Pair 2: Alma₂'s Preaching vs. Sons of Mosiah's Mission**

| Story | Apparent Mode | But Actually... |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Alma₂** (Alma 4-16) | **Integrate/Defer** — skilled orator, institutional authority, professional preaching from privilege. Results mixed (general success + Ammonihah disaster). | But Alma₂ is also the current high priest — his institutional position IS a spiritual calling. And at Ammonihah, divine intervention eventually comes (angel, then city's destruction). The "competent" preacher still relies on revelation for his sermon content. More **Integrate** than pure Defer. |
| **Sons of Mosiah** (Alma 17-27) | **Strip** — they renounce royal status, offer themselves as servants, face hostility. Results extraordinary: permanent converts, miraculous conversions. | But Alma 17:2-3 says they "had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth" and "were men of a sound understanding" who "searched the scriptures diligently." They were deeply *prepared* — this is **Enhance** (Spirit enhancing rigorous preparation) as much as Strip. The text itself resists the clean blessedness reading. |

**Pair 3: Moroni vs. Helaman₂'s Stripling Warriors**

| Story | Apparent Mode | But Actually... |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Moroni** (Alma 52-62) | **Defer** — professional military skill, strategic maneuvering. Mormon praises him but notes tensions (temper, intemperate letters, never prays personally, loses cities). | But Mormon gives him 14 chapters and the extraordinary tribute "if all men had been like unto Moroni..." This isn't pure Defer — it's Mormon honoring competence as genuinely praiseworthy while showing its limits. The tribute doesn't quite fit the evidence, suggesting Mormon *wants* competence to be valued even as he privileges blessedness narratively. |
| **Helaman₂** (Alma 56-58) | **Strip + Enhance** — a high priest with no military background leads untrained youth. They fight with "miraculous strength." Not one falls in first battle. | But they DO fight — real combat, real courage, real blood loss (200 faint but none die). This is not Replace (God acting alone while humans stand still). It's **Enhance**: human effort + miraculous amplification of that effort. The warriors are active participants whose inadequate competence is supernaturally boosted, not bypassed. |

**What this reveals:**

1. **None of the six stories maps cleanly to a single mode.** Every one involves multiple modes or sits between modes. The binary flattens this.

2. **The "competence" stories are less purely competent than Hardy's framework suggests.** Limhi's escape may have had invisible divine involvement. Alma₂ is a spiritual leader, not just a professional. Moroni receives a tribute that strains the evidence.

3. **The "blessedness" stories are less purely miraculous than the framework suggests.** The Sons of Mosiah were rigorously prepared scholars. The stripling warriors fight with real courage. Alma₁'s deliverance comes in stages (burden-lightening before escape).

4. **Mormon himself softens the binary.** He has Alma₁ preach to Limhi's people that God was in their "competent" escape. He notes the Sons of Mosiah's diligent preparation. He gives Moroni an extraordinary tribute. Hardy's own analysis shows Mormon acknowledging the inadequacy of a clean split even while constructing one.

5. **Hardy's real insight, rereading his conclusion, is not that blessedness trumps competence but that "God will respond in predictable ways BOTH to those who serve him competently AND ALSO to those who seek blessings beyond their capacities."** The *reliability of divine response across different human postures* is the lesson — which maps better to the repertoire concept (God has multiple reliable modes) than to the binary (one mode is privileged).

### Model Update

**Before Round 2:** The competence/blessedness binary was the frame — the question was whether it was real or constructed, central or peripheral.

**Round 2 revealed:** The binary is one cross-section of a richer repertoire. Both monks' evidence, taken together, maps at least eight distinct modes of divine engagement with human agency. The binary isolates the most dramatically legible modes (Replace/Strip vs. Integrate/Defer) but misses modes that are equally scriptural and equally important (Enhance, Instruct, Withdraw, Presence).

**Updated model:** God's character is expressed through an irreducible repertoire of modes, where the repertoire itself — not any single mode — is the "pattern." Mormon's editorial genius was to isolate and dramatize the most legible cross-section of this repertoire. His perception was genuine but partial. The fuller picture requires the testimony of multiple prophets perceiving different modes — which is what the standard works, read as a whole, actually provide.
