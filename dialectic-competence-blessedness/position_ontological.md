# The Signature of a Constant God: Why Providential Recurrence Is Ontologically Real

## Position: The competence/blessedness pattern reflects genuine divine pedagogy, not editorial invention

---

There is a God who acts in history, and He does not change. This is the foundational premise from which everything follows. If God's character is constant --- if He is the same yesterday, today, and forever (Hebrews 13:8; Mormon 9:9) --- then His responses to structurally similar situations will display structural similarity. Not because a narrator imposed the pattern, but because the same Person is acting. Providential recurrence is the visible signature of divine constancy operating across time. The pattern inheres in the events because the same God is their author. Mormon did not create it. He was given prophetic eyes to see what was already there.

Grant Hardy's analysis in *Understanding the Book of Mormon* documents three paired narratives spanning roughly 200 pages of text --- Limhi and Alma's deliverances, Alma the Younger's preaching tour and the sons of Mosiah's mission, Captain Moroni and Helaman's stripling warriors --- each contrasting faithful human competence with miraculous divine intervention. Hardy demonstrates the editorial craft behind these pairings with precision: matched block lengths, shared distinctive phrases ("gathered their flocks," "departed into the wilderness"), the systematic placement of the miraculous narrative second, the dampening of competent success and the elevation of faith-dependent triumph. He shows us the seams. And in showing us the seams, he thinks he has shown us the mechanism. He has not.

## The Opposing Argument at Full Strength

The editorial construction case, stated in terms its proponents would endorse, runs as follows. Mormon had a millennium of source material --- the large plates of Nephi, the small plates, correspondence, official records. From this vast archive he selected specific episodes, arranged them in deliberate sequence, matched their structural proportions, imposed shared vocabulary, and consistently weighted the miraculous over the competent. He controlled the Limhi narrative so thoroughly that God's name never appears in Mosiah 22, while Alma's deliverance in chapters 23--24 becomes an explicit theodicy. He structured Alma the Younger's preaching tour to foreground the Ammonihah disaster --- making the competent preacher look less successful than he was --- while building the sons of Mosiah narrative toward escalating miracles and permanent converts. He praised Moroni with a tribute that doesn't match the textual evidence of Moroni's actual temperament, then made Helaman's untrained warriors miraculously invulnerable. Hayden White would say this is emplotment, pure and simple: "no events are intrinsically tragic" --- and by extension, no sequence of events intrinsically displays a competence-to-blessedness arc. The pattern is Mormon's theological conviction projected backward onto his sources.

Furthermore, Hardy himself notes that the next generation's similar military conflict receives six verses of coverage. The pattern vanishes when it no longer serves the editorial thesis. The suspicious symmetry --- three pairs, each escalating, each with connecting tissue linking the miraculous tale forward to the next pair --- looks less like the fingerprint of Providence and more like the architecture of a sophisticated theological argument.

This is not a compelling case. Here is why it fails at the structural level.

## Why "Merely Editorial" Collapses

The editorial construction thesis rests on an assumption so deeply embedded that its proponents rarely state it: that human craft and divine truth are competing explanations for the same phenomenon. If Mormon shaped the narrative, God didn't. If literary artistry is present, historical reality recedes. This is a zero-sum metaphysics of authorship, and it is wrong.

Austin Farrer's concept of double agency dismantles this assumption at its root. As Diogenes Allen summarizes Farrer's position: "The activities of every created being are simultaneously their own activities and divine activities." Herbert McCabe presses the point further: God's creative activity "does not make any difference to my activity. It makes it what it is in the first place." Divine and creaturely causation do not compete because they do not operate on the same causal plane. God's action does not displace Mormon's editorial judgment; God's action operates *through* Mormon's editorial judgment. The craft is not the alternative to revelation. The craft is the instrument of revelation.

Meir Sternberg understood this about biblical narrative generally. He insisted the Hebrew Bible represents "historiography pure and uncompromising" --- not despite its literary artistry but through it. "The very choice to devise an omniscient narrator serves the purpose of staging and glorifying an omniscient God." The literary technique makes a theological claim about divine authorization. Sternberg argues that "under the aegis of ideology, convention transmutes even invention into the stuff of history" --- which is to say that within the framework of prophetic historiography, the narrator's craft does not undermine the truth-claim but constitutes it. The artistry is how the truth gets communicated. Strip away the artistry and you do not get closer to the truth; you lose access to it entirely.

The editorial construction view fails because it assumes that identifying Mormon's craft is the same as explaining away the pattern. But showing *how* a prophet communicates a truth is not the same as showing the truth does not exist. We do not say that because a telescope was manufactured in a workshop, the stars it reveals are artifacts of lens-grinding. Mormon's editorial choices --- his selection, arrangement, emphasis, and shared vocabulary --- are the lens through which a real pattern becomes visible. The lens has a shape. That does not mean the stars are imaginary.

## Prophetic Craft as Revelation

The Restoration provides the precise theological framework for understanding how editorial craft and divine truth coexist. Doctrine and Covenants 9:8 describes the revelatory process: "you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right." Revelation is not dictation. It is the convergence of intellectual labor and spiritual confirmation. Mormon studying his sources, identifying patterns, selecting paired narratives, crafting shared vocabulary --- this *is* the revelatory process, not a substitute for it. The prophet-editor does not impose patterns on inert material; the prophet-editor is given discernment to recognize patterns that are genuinely present in the material. His "studying it out" is the first half of the revelatory act. The burning in the bosom --- the prophetic confirmation that the pattern is real --- is the second half.

This is why Hardy's evidence of editorial control actually strengthens the ontological claim rather than weakening it. Hardy shows us a prophet doing exactly what D&C 9:8 describes: working intellectually with source material, making judgments about significance, arranging evidence to surface a thesis. If Mormon had simply transcribed records without editorial intervention, we would have raw data but no prophetic insight. The editorial craft *is* the prophetic contribution. It is how the Lord's "manner of speaking" (2 Nephi 31:3) operates through a human mind trained on a thousand years of sacred history.

## The Gideon Principle as Divine Pedagogy

The competence/blessedness pattern is not unique to Mormon's editorial vision. It appears wherever God acts in history, precisely because it reflects something real about how God teaches. The Gideon narrative in Judges 7 states the principle explicitly: God reduces the army from 32,000 to 300 "lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me." This is not a narrative trope. It is a divine pedagogy --- God deliberately constraining human resources to make His action visible.

The same pedagogy operates in David rejecting Saul's professional armor to fight Goliath with a sling. In Peter the professional fisherman catching nothing all night, then filling his nets at Jesus' word. In Paul the trained rhetorician repudiating rhetoric: "My strength is made perfect in weakness" (2 Corinthians 12:9). In the feeding of the five thousand, where the disciples' competent logistics ("send them to buy food") are replaced by miraculous multiplication of inadequate means. In Ether 12:27: "I give unto men weakness that they may be humble" --- where God Himself claims authorship of the weakness, not as punishment but as pedagogical design.

The cross-traditional evidence deepens the case. Hinduism's Vaishnavite cat-and-monkey schools map almost exactly onto the competence/blessedness tension. Buddhism's jiriki/tariki distinction --- self-power versus other-power --- recapitulates it. Islam's "tie your camel and trust in Allah" expresses its synthesis. That this pattern appears independently across traditions that share no textual genealogy is evidence of its ontological reality. A narrative convention borrowed from tradition to tradition would show lines of literary influence. A genuine feature of divine-human interaction would show up independently wherever humans encounter the divine. It shows up independently.

## The Uncomfortable Conclusion

If the competence/blessedness pattern is ontologically real --- if it reflects genuine divine pedagogy rather than editorial construction --- then we must accept its full implications. God deliberately withholds miraculous intervention from competent people. Not because He is absent, not because He is punishing them, but because He is teaching something different through them. Limhi's people escape by human cleverness, and God lets them, because the contrast with Alma's miraculous deliverance teaches both groups something neither could learn alone. Moroni builds his fortifications and fights his strategic battles, and God lets him struggle, because the contrast with Helaman's miraculously preserved warriors teaches the entire Nephite nation something about the relationship between human effort and divine power.

This means the competence/blessedness pattern is not merely descriptive but prescriptive. God is not passively allowing different outcomes; He is actively orchestrating the contrast. He is reducing Gideon's army. He is giving men weakness. He is designing situations where human competence operates at its ceiling precisely so that miraculous intervention, when it comes, is unmistakable. The LDS lay ministry system --- in which members routinely serve in positions they lack professional qualifications for --- is this theology institutionalized. The system operates below the threshold of professional competence not by accident but by design, because the theological point requires visible reliance on divine enablement.

## The Load-Bearing Structure

My argument rests on three premises, and I will name them so their structural role is visible.

First: God's character is constant. If this falls --- if God is arbitrary, capricious, or so radically free that His actions display no recurring character --- then providential recurrence is impossible in principle, and Francesca Murphy is right that "story" domesticates a God who resists narrative containment. But a constant God is not a predictable God in the mechanical sense. He is a Person whose character is stable enough to generate recognizable patterns of action while remaining free enough to surprise. The constancy of character is exactly what makes the pattern intelligible without making it deterministic.

Second: prophetic historiography is a real epistemic category. Not all historians are prophets, and not all editorial choices are revelatory. But within the framework of sacred history, a prophet-editor's craft operates under divine authorization that transforms selection and arrangement into acts of discernment rather than acts of invention. If prophetic historiography is not a real category --- if every editor is equally constructing meaning from raw data --- then Sternberg's distinction between historiography and fiction collapses, and we have no basis for treating any scriptural narrative as more than literature. I reject that conclusion.

Third: the cross-traditional independence of the pattern constitutes evidence of its reality. If competence/blessedness appeared only in Mormon's editorial work, the construction thesis would be stronger. That it appears in the Deuteronomistic History, in the Gospels, in Paul, in Hindu devotional theology, in Buddhist soteriology, in Islamic piety --- without shared literary ancestry --- indicates that multiple independent witnesses are observing the same phenomenon. The simplest explanation for independent convergence on the same pattern is that the pattern is real.

If any of these three premises fails, the argument weakens substantially. If all three hold, then the competence/blessedness pattern is what Mormon says it is: not his invention but his discovery, not his theological lens but his prophetic testimony, not a story he tells about God but a story God tells about Himself through the medium of sacred history and the instrument of a prophet's consecrated craft.
