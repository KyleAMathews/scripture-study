# Round 2, Monk B: The Scriptures Are Messier Than the Binary

## The Standard Works Resist the Frame

Round 1 gave us a beautiful synthesis: sacred history as an "entangled medium" where prophetic editorial craft and divine disclosure are the same act. I accept that synthesis as far as it goes. But it has a blind spot the size of the entire standard works. It treats the competence/blessedness pattern as *the* signature of God's character -- taking three paired narratives from a 200-page stretch of the Book of Mormon as the master key to divine-human interaction.

The standard works do not cooperate. When you walk through the scriptural record -- all four volumes, both testaments, the Restoration scriptures -- you find a vast, unruly landscape of divine action that the binary cannot contain. The competence/blessedness framework illuminates some stories and badly distorts others. It is a pattern, not *the* pattern. Treating it as primary flattens the very scriptures it claims to honor.

## 1. Competence AS Miracle: God's Intervention Takes the Form of Enhanced Skill

The competence/blessedness binary assumes these are separable poles: either you use your own skill (competence) or God bypasses your skill (blessedness). But a large class of scriptural stories shows God's intervention taking the form of supernatural competence enhancement -- the Spirit filling someone with *skill*, not replacing skill with miracle.

**Bezalel and the Tabernacle artisans (Exodus 31:2-6).** God tells Moses: "I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in cutting of stones" ([Exodus 31:3-5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/31.3?lang=eng#p3)). And further: "in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee" ([Exodus 31:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/31.6?lang=eng#p6)). The Spirit of God manifests here as craftsmanship. Not as fire from heaven, not as walls falling down, not as armies scattered. As goldsmithing. As stonecutting. As artistic design. The competence/blessedness binary has no place for this. Is Bezalel "competent" or "blessed"? He is both simultaneously, and the text sees no tension whatsoever. God's intervention *is* the skill.

**Daniel in Babylon (Daniel 1:17-20).** "God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom" ([Daniel 1:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/1.17?lang=eng#p17)). The result: "he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm" ([Daniel 1:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/1.20?lang=eng#p20)). Daniel's divine gift is not a miracle that bypasses learning -- it is learning itself, supernaturally enhanced. He masters the Babylonian curriculum and outperforms the professionals. The competence/blessedness pattern would predict a naif who succeeds through miraculous intervention despite lacking training. Instead, he is the most competent person in the room *because* of divine intervention.

**Nephi building the ship (1 Nephi 17-18).** This story is routinely read as blessedness -- God helps Nephi despite his brothers' mockery. But read the text carefully. Nephi asks where to find ore to make *tools* ([1 Nephi 17:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p9#p9)). He smelts metal. He forges implements. He works "timbers of curious workmanship" while "the Lord did show me from time to time after what manner I should work the timbers of the ship" ([1 Nephi 18:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)). Nephi insists the design was "not after the manner of men" ([1 Nephi 18:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p2#p2)), but the construction was real carpentry, real metallurgy, real labor. God's intervention came as *instruction* -- divine tutoring in a craft, not divine bypassing of craft. This is the Bezalel model, not the Gideon model. Competence and miracle are not opposing poles here; the miracle *is* the competence.

**The Sons of Mosiah themselves.** Hardy's pattern casts them as the "blessedness" pole opposite Alma's "competence." But look at what the text actually says about their preparation: "they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God" ([Alma 17:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17?lang=eng&id=p2#p2)). Sound understanding. Diligent scripture study. These are competence markers. They also "had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy" ([Alma 17:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)). The text describes rigorous spiritual preparation yielding spiritual power -- not untrained weakness producing miraculous results. Even Hardy's own exemplar of blessedness is, in the text, deeply competent.

## 2. Blessedness That Fails: Faithful Dependence Without Miraculous Deliverance

The competence/blessedness pattern implicitly promises that complete dependence on God produces miraculous outcomes. But the standard works contain a devastating counter-tradition: the faithful who depend entirely on God and die anyway.

**Abinadi (Mosiah 17:10-13).** "Yea, and I will suffer even until death, and I will not recall my words" ([Mosiah 17:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/17?lang=eng&id=p10#p10)). Abinadi is the pure blessedness figure -- no army, no clever plan, no institutional authority. Just a prophet confronting a wicked king with nothing but the word of God. The competence/blessedness pattern predicts miraculous intervention. What happens? "They took him and bound him, and scourged his skin with faggots, yea, even unto death" ([Mosiah 17:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/17?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)). No deliverance. No deep sleep falling on the guards. No walls crumbling. The same God who sent supernatural drowsiness on Lamanite guards for Alma's people watches Abinadi burn.

**The believers at Ammonihah (Alma 14:8-11).** The women and children who believe Alma and Amulek's preaching are "cast into the fire" along with the holy scriptures ([Alma 14:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)). Amulek wants to intervene. Alma refuses: "The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory" ([Alma 14:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p11#p11)). These believers are maximally dependent on God -- no competence, no plan, no escape route. And God's response is not deliverance but *reception in death*. The "blessedness" here is martyrdom, not miracle. The framework cannot absorb this.

**The Hebrews 11 counter-list.** The author of Hebrews spends thirty-four verses cataloging faith-driven miracles, then pivots devastatingly: "others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection" ([Hebrews 11:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11.35?lang=eng#p35)). "They were stoned, they were sawn asunder... being destitute, afflicted, tormented" ([Hebrews 11:37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11.37?lang=eng#p37)). And the conclusion: "these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise" ([Hebrews 11:39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11.39?lang=eng#p39)). The author of Hebrews knows the competence/blessedness pattern -- and deliberately breaks it. Faith does not always produce deliverance. The "good report" comes through faithfulness, not through results. The pattern predicts miracle; the text delivers suffering.

**Job.** The entire book is a 42-chapter refutation of the idea that faithfulness produces predictable divine outcomes. Job's friends *are* the competence/blessedness framework: if you're suffering, you must have failed in faith. Job's response -- "shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?" ([Job 2:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/2.10?lang=eng#p10)) -- insists that divine action is not reducible to any formula linking human disposition to divine response. God's answer from the whirlwind offers no explanatory pattern at all. It offers *presence*.

**Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail (D&C 122:7).** "Know thou, my son, that all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" ([D&C 122:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7?lang=eng#p7)). No miraculous deliverance. No army of angels. No earthquake breaking the prison walls (that comes later, at Carthage, and it does not save him). God's response to the prophet's imprisonment is not the blessedness of supernatural intervention but the mysterious claim that suffering itself is the divine gift.

## 3. The Integration Model: Where the Binary Dissolves Entirely

Many of the most important scriptural narratives do not sit at either pole of the competence/blessedness axis. They occupy a space where human skill and divine favor are so completely entangled that separating them is not merely difficult but incoherent.

**Joseph in Egypt (Genesis 39-41).** "The Lord was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man" ([Genesis 39:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/39.2?lang=eng#p2)). Joseph rises through Potiphar's house, through prison, to Pharaoh's court through a seamless blend of administrative competence and divine favor. Pharaoh perceives both simultaneously: "Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?... there is none so discreet and wise as thou art" ([Genesis 41:38-39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/41.38?lang=eng#p38)). "Spirit of God" and "discreet and wise" are not opposing categories. They describe one person, one career, one mode of action. Joseph is the anti-Gideon: God never reduces his resources, never strips away his competence to make the divine role visible. Joseph succeeds through a blend that defies the binary.

**Nehemiah's wall-building (Nehemiah 2-6).** "We made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night" ([Nehemiah 4:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/4.9?lang=eng#p9)). Prayer AND armed guards. "Remember the Lord, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren" ([Nehemiah 4:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/4.14?lang=eng#p14)). Remember AND fight. The workers "with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon" ([Nehemiah 4:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/4.17?lang=eng#p17)). A trowel in one hand and a sword in the other -- the emblem of the integrated life that refuses the competence/blessedness split. The wall gets finished in fifty-two days. No miracle. No drama. Just faithful, competent work under divine blessing, with no interest in telling you which part was God and which part was Nehemiah.

**D&C 9:8 and the revelation model.** "You must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right" ([D&C 9:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.8?lang=eng#p8)). Intellectual effort AND spiritual confirmation as a single process. God does not say "your study is the competence pole and my confirmation is the blessedness pole." He presents them as one integrated method. The Restoration's own epistemology of revelation refuses the binary.

## 4. Neither Mode Applies: Divine Action Off the Axis Entirely

Large regions of the standard works portray divine action that has nothing to do with the competence/blessedness axis at all. God does not always interact with humans through the lens of their effort or lack thereof.

**Creation.** "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" ([Genesis 1:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1.1?lang=eng#p1)). No human competence to bypass or enhance. No human dependence to reward with miracle. Creation precedes and constitutes the conditions under which competence and blessedness become possible at all. The most fundamental divine act in scripture does not fit the pattern.

**Covenant-making.** When God appears to Abram and Abram "believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness" ([Genesis 15:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/15.6?lang=eng#p6)), the category is not competence or blessedness but *relationship*. Covenant is God binding himself to a people -- not rewarding competence, not intervening miraculously, but establishing an ongoing personal commitment. The entire structure of biblical religion is covenantal, and covenant sits outside the competence/blessedness framework entirely.

**The still small voice (1 Kings 19:12).** Elijah has just experienced the ultimate blessedness event -- fire from heaven on Mount Carmel. Now, fleeing Jezebel, God appears not in wind, earthquake, or fire, but in "a still small voice" ([1 Kings 19:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19.12?lang=eng#p12)). The text deliberately deconstructs the spectacular-miracle model. God was *not* in the earthquake. God was *not* in the fire. The same God who sent fire on Carmel now communicates through quiet intimacy. This is not competence. This is not blessedness. This is *presence*, and it resists every framework that tries to categorize divine action by its mode of dramatic intervention.

## 5. Competence Rewarded Without Contrast

The wisdom literature tradition, which spans Proverbs, parts of the Psalms, and significant Restoration scripture, consistently celebrates human diligence and skill as divinely approved -- with no blessedness foil required.

**Proverbs' theology of diligence.** "The hand of the diligent shall bear rule" ([Proverbs 12:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/12.24?lang=eng#p24)). "The hand of the diligent maketh rich" ([Proverbs 10:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/10.4?lang=eng#p4)). "Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise" ([Proverbs 6:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/6.6?lang=eng#p6)). "Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings" ([Proverbs 22:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/22.29?lang=eng#p29)). Proverbs never suggests that diligence needs to be contrasted with miraculous dependence. It simply praises competence as the wise and godly path. There is no blessedness pole, no Gideon principle, no dramatic stripping of resources. Just skill honored by God.

**The Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:21-26).** The master's praise: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things" ([Matthew 25:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25.21?lang=eng#p21)). The condemnation of the servant who buried his talent: "Thou wicked and slothful servant" ([Matthew 25:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25.26?lang=eng#p26)). Jesus' own parable about the kingdom of heaven rewards initiative, investment, productive competence. The wicked servant's failure is not insufficient faith -- it is insufficient *effort*. The blessedness model, taken seriously, would praise the servant who did nothing and trusted God for the increase. Jesus condemns him.

**D&C 58:26-28.** "It is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant" ([D&C 58:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.26?lang=eng#p26)). "Men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will" ([D&C 58:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.27?lang=eng#p27)). "For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves" ([D&C 58:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.28?lang=eng#p28)). This is a direct rebuke of the blessedness-as-default model. God explicitly says he does not want people waiting for divine commands. The *power is in them*. Agency and initiative are the godly mode. Dependence-as-passivity is slothfulness. The Restoration's own theology of human action pushes hard against treating miraculous blessedness as the privileged pole.

## The Real Landscape

The competence/blessedness binary works for Limhi and Alma. It works for Gideon and David. It works for a handful of stories where Mormon (or the Deuteronomistic historians, or Luke) deliberately constructs a dramatic contrast. But these are the *dramatic stories* -- the ones editors choose precisely because they make clean pedagogical points.

Most of scripture lives somewhere else. It lives in the Bezalel space, where the Spirit manifests as skill. It lives in the Abinadi space, where faithfulness produces martyrdom, not miracle. It lives in the Joseph-in-Egypt space, where competence and divine favor are the same thing. It lives in the Nehemiah space, where you pray and set a guard simultaneously. It lives in the Proverbs space, where diligence is godliness and no blessedness contrast is needed. It lives in the Job space, where God refuses to fit any pattern at all.

Hardy showed that Mormon was a brilliant editor. Correct. But brilliant editors select. Mormon foregrounds the dramatic contest stories -- the Gideon-pattern deliverances where God strips resources and intervenes spectacularly. He backgrounds the Bezalel stories, the Nehemiah stories, the Proverbs theology of patient diligence. His 200-page masterpiece of paired narratives is genuinely impressive editorial work. But it is not a map of divine action. It is a curated exhibition of one mode of divine action, presented as if it were the whole gallery.

D&C 58 says the power is in us. Proverbs says the diligent hand shall rule. Exodus 31 says the Spirit fills craftsmen with skill. Daniel 1 says God grants mastery of worldly learning. Genesis 39-41 says the Lord prospers competent administrators. Jesus says the servant who invests his talents wisely enters the joy of his lord. These are not minor footnotes. They are a massive counter-witness that God regularly works *through* human competence rather than *despite* it -- without needing a dramatic contrast to make the theological point.

The competence/blessedness pattern is real. Mormon saw something. But what he saw was one facet of a diamond with dozens of faces. Treating his three paired narratives as the signature of God's character is like treating Mount Carmel as the whole theology of Elijah and ignoring the still small voice. The scriptures are wilder, messier, and more honest about the diversity of divine action than any single editorial framework can contain. The standard works refuse to be tamed by binary.
