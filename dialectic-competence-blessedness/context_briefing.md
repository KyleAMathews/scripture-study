# Context Briefing: Competence vs. Blessedness — Is Providential Recurrence Real?

## The Source Material

Grant Hardy's analysis of Mormon's parallel narratives in the Book of Mormon ("Providential Recurrence: Parallel Narratives," from *Understanding the Book of Mormon*) identifies a large-scale editorial pattern across approximately 200 pages of the text (Mosiah through Alma). Mormon constructs three paired narratives that consistently contrast two modes of faithful action:

- **Competence**: Faithful people using their own skills, planning, and effort to accomplish God's purposes
- **Blessedness**: Faithful people trusting beyond their abilities and receiving miraculous divine intervention

Both modes are honored. Neither is criticized. But the narrative consistently places the miraculous second, gives it more dramatic weight, and links it forward to the next narrative pair.

## The Three Pairs in Detail

### Pair 1: The Deliverances of Limhi's People and Alma₁'s People (Mosiah 22 and 23–24)

**Competence (Limhi):** After three failed military rebellions, Limhi's people escape Lamanite bondage through Gideon's clever plan — extra wine for the guards, slip out the back when they're drunk. Ordinary human ingenuity. God is never mentioned in Mosiah 22. Gideon becomes a national hero with a city named after him.

**Blessedness (Alma₁):** Alma's people, enslaved by the same Lamanites, cannot devise an escape plan. They appeal to God. He first lightens their burdens (responding to faith), then causes a "deep sleep" to fall on the Lamanites. They walk out with zero interference. God explicitly receives credit: "none could deliver them except it were the Lord their God."

**Editorial craft:** Mormon tells these stories consecutively, uses shared distinctive phrases ("gathered their flocks," "departed into the wilderness," "arrived in the land of Zarahemla," "Mosiah received them with joy"), and employs the rare phrase "none could deliver them but the Lord" four times — always connected to these two groups. He then has Alma₁ preach to Limhi's people specifically, reminding them "it was the Lord that did deliver them" — softening the contrast and suggesting God was involved in Limhi's escape too, just less visibly.

### Pair 2: Alma₂'s Preaching Tour and the Sons of Mosiah's Mission (Alma 4–16 and 17–27)

**Competence (Alma₂):** Alma resigns as chief judge to preach a Nephite Reformation. He is a skilled orator, a former chief judge, the current high priest — he speaks from professional expertise and institutional authority. He preaches formal sermons at Zarahemla, Gideon, Melek, and Ammonihah. Results are substantial but mixed: general church establishment, but Ammonihah is a disaster. His preaching style is polished, confident, rhetorically sophisticated. He operates from a position of privilege and jurisdiction.

**Blessedness (Sons of Mosiah):** Ammon, Aaron, and brothers renounce royal status, go to the Lamanites — "a wild and hardened and ferocious people." They face language barriers, cultural gaps, hostile audiences. They "fasted and prayed much," offered themselves as servants, suffered afflictions. Their preaching is conversational, step-by-step, "led by the Spirit." Results are extraordinary: kings converted through spiritual trances, thousands join the church, converts never fall away, the Anti-Nephi-Lehies choose death over breaking their covenant.

**Editorial craft:** Mormon structures both as three-episode narrative blocks of similar length despite covering vastly different time periods (2 years vs. 14 years). Each contains a lengthy digression and an account of martyred innocents. He devotes the majority of Alma's section to the Ammonihah disaster (dampening success), while the sons of Mosiah narrative builds toward escalating miracles. He includes Alma's own wistful comparison: "O that I were an angel..." followed by his reconciliation to his own gifts.

### Pair 3: Captain Moroni and Helaman₂'s Stripling Warriors (Alma 52–62)

**Competence (Moroni):** Moroni is a skilled military professional — armor, spies, ambushes, fortifications, strategic maneuvering. Mormon gives him an extraordinary tribute ("if all men had been like unto Moroni...") and devotes 14 chapters to his career. But Hardy notes tensions: Moroni never prays personally, has a fierce temper, writes intemperate letters, slaughters political opponents, loses cities despite his preparations, breaks off negotiations rashly. He's compared to the sons of Mosiah but resembles them hardly at all. His success comes through professional military skill.

**Blessedness (Helaman₂):** The high priest over the church, with no military background, leads 2,000 young men whose parents had covenanted never to fight. They fight with "miraculous strength." In their first battle, not one falls. In the second, 200 faint from blood loss but none die, while 1,000 of the regular troops are killed. Over and over: faith, prayers, trusting the Lord, "miraculous power of God." Meanwhile Helaman's force retakes cities on the western front with minimal bloodshed, while Moroni loses Nephihah in the east.

**Editorial craft:** Mormon gives both campaigns roughly equal narrative space despite their very different scales. He inserts the Moroni tribute at a moment that doesn't quite fit the evidence. The next generation's similar conflict gets six verses; Helaman's campaign gets extended treatment precisely because it illustrates the pattern.

## The Connecting Thread

Hardy observes that the second tale in each pair connects to the next pair:
- Alma₁'s church (miraculous deliverance) → is the organization Alma₂ tries to reform
- Sons of Mosiah's converts (miraculous mission) → are the parents of Helaman₂'s stripling warriors
- The pattern builds across 200 pages of text

This represents "a remarkable level of editorial control or even literary achievement, though Mormon would undoubtedly disavow his own creativity, claiming instead merely to be making manifest the moral principles of history."

## The Core Tension

**Is the competence/blessedness pattern a feature of how God actually operates, or a feature of how Mormon thinks about God?**

### Evidence for ontological reality:
- Mormon is constrained by sources — he cannot freely invent
- The "thus we see" formula claims to extract, not impose
- Some parallels are initiated by God himself (e.g., God speaks to Abinadi in Mosaic language)
- The pattern appears across a thousand years of independent history
- Mormon explicitly deflects credit from his own craft: "I know the record which I make to be a just and a true record"
- The theology is coherent: a constant God would respond predictably to similar situations

### Evidence for editorial construction:
- Mormon selects from a vast archive — he has a millennium of material to choose from
- He controls arrangement — telling paired stories consecutively, matching block lengths
- He controls phrasing — shared distinctive phrases create the sense of parallel
- The three-pair structure is suspiciously symmetrical for messy history
- He gives the miraculous tale more dramatic weight in every pair
- He dampens Alma₂'s success by foregrounding Ammonihah
- He inflates Moroni's stature with a tribute that doesn't match the evidence
- Hardy shows the editorial seams: Mormon's "cautious editorial foreshadowing," his "uncomfortable" justifications, his choice to tell a generation-long conflict in six verses when it doesn't serve the pattern

### The deeper question:
Can a pattern be both editorially constructed AND theologically true? Does acknowledging the craft diminish the revelation — or is the craft itself a form of revelation (the prophet-editor seeing what's actually there in the record)?

## Broader Scriptural Context

The tension between providential recurrence and editorial construction is not unique to the Book of Mormon:

- **Hebrew Bible type-scenes** (Robert Alter): annunciation to barren mothers, betrothal at wells, epiphany in the field — these are literary conventions, but do they reflect recurring divine action or narrative tradition?
- **The Deuteronomistic History**: the editor(s) of Joshua–Kings impose a recurring cycle (faithfulness → blessing → apostasy → punishment → repentance → deliverance) on Israelite history. Noth argued this was editorial framework imposed by a redactor; the formulaic "the people of Israel did what was evil" (Judges 3:7, 3:12, 4:1, 10:6, 13:1) is widely recognized as an editorial device structuring pre-existing tribal hero stories. Is this the pattern of history or the pattern of the editor's theology?
- **Luke-Acts**: Luke structures Jesus' journey to Jerusalem and Paul's journey to Rome in deliberate parallel. Richard Pervo argues "history cannot be so symmetrical" — the parallels are evidence of literary artistry, not historical correspondence.
- **Typology in Paul**: Adam/Christ, Hagar-Sarah/old covenant-new covenant — Paul reads history as genuinely patterned, not just narratively shaped.
- **The Gospels themselves**: Four accounts of the same events with different editorial choices, different arrangements, different theological emphases — same underlying reality, four constructions of meaning.

Hardy himself draws the comparison with Thucydides, who structured the Peloponnesian War as two parallel ten-year wars through "selection, emphasis, and juxtaposition." Thucydides' parallels reveal something true about how wars work — but he also created the parallels through editorial choices. The historian "is more than a recorder of facts — he is an artist."

### Key Scholarly Positions

**Meir Sternberg** insists biblical narrative is "historiography pure and uncompromising" — not fiction or historicized fiction but genuine historical writing. The literary artistry does not diminish the truth-claim; it is how truth is communicated.

**Hans Frei** argues for the "history-like" nature of biblical narrative: meaning is established through narrative character itself, not through external historical verification. Christ's identity is depicted through the story, not behind it.

**Hayden White** represents the opposite pole: "no events are intrinsically tragic" — narrative structure (emplotment) is always imposed by the historian. "Unless at least two versions of the same set of events can be imagined, there is no reason for the historian to take upon himself the authority of giving the true account." Events don't demand a particular story shape; the historian chooses.

**Francesca Murphy** (*God is Not a Story*) critiques narrative theology: the concept of "story" becomes circular and self-referential. "The scriptural revelation on which Christian theology depends is not a story or a plot but a dramatic encounter between mysterious, free, and unpredictable persons." If God is truly free, his actions cannot be reduced to narrative patterns.

**Thomas Mackay** on Mormon's editorial DNA: Mormon "leaves 'DNA fingerprints'" revealing consistent editorial choices shaped by his "providential philosophy of history." He measures civilization by "righteousness and charity, not physical achievements or material prosperity" — a theological lens that determines what he considers historically significant.

## The Competence/Blessedness Pattern Across World Scriptures

Research reveals this is not just a Book of Mormon phenomenon. The tension between faithful human competence and miraculous divine intervention appears across multiple religious traditions:

### Biblical Examples (Old Testament)
- **Gideon** (Judges 7): God reduces the army from 32,000 to 300 — "lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me." The deliberate reduction of human resources to make divine action visible.
- **David and Goliath** (1 Samuel 17): David strips off Saul's professional armor and fights with a shepherd's sling. The rejection of competent means in favor of trust in God.
- **Jericho vs. Ai** (Joshua 6–8): Jericho falls by miracle (marching, trumpets, walls collapse). Ai is taken by military ambush. Same campaign, two modes, no explanation for the switch.
- **Nehemiah** (Nehemiah 4:9): "We made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch" — prayer AND competent preparation simultaneously.
- **The Spies in Numbers** (Numbers 13–14): Competent assessment ("the land is good but the people are strong") vs. Caleb/Joshua's faith ("God will deliver it").
- **Zechariah 4:6**: "Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts" — the programmatic statement of the blessedness pole.

### Biblical Examples (New Testament)
- **Peter on the water**: Professional fisherman's competence fails (Luke 5:5: "toiled all night, caught nothing"), then obeys Jesus' word and catches abundantly. Same man later walks on water — pure faith, no skill applies.
- **Paul**: Trained rhetorician who deliberately repudiates rhetoric: "My speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom" (1 Cor 2:4). "My strength is made perfect in weakness" (2 Cor 12:9).
- **Feeding of the 5,000**: Disciples offer competent logistics ("send them to buy food"). Jesus takes five inadequate loaves and multiplies them.
- **Acts oscillates**: Pentecost (miraculous) and appointing deacons (organizational competence) in the same community without discomfort.

### Cross-Traditional Parallels
- **Islam**: The hadith "Tie your camel and trust in Allah" (Tirmidhi 2517). Tawakkul (trust in God) follows, not replaces, human effort. The Quran commands both firm resolution AND reliance on Allah (3:159). Islam pushes toward the Nehemiah model — competence + trust. Notably, Islam lacks a strong Gideon-pattern tradition of God deliberately stripping away resources.
- **Hinduism**: The cat-and-monkey schools of Vaishnavism. The Vadakalai (monkey school) say salvation requires human effort — like a baby monkey clinging to its mother. The Tenkalai (cat school) say the kitten contributes nothing — the mother carries it entirely. This maps almost exactly onto the competence/blessedness tension and the debate has continued for centuries.
- **Buddhism**: Jiriki (self-power) vs. tariki (other-power). Zen emphasizes personal discipline and effort. Pure Land Buddhism emphasizes reliance on Amitabha's saving power. Shinran pushed tariki to its extreme: self-power has NO influence on salvation. The Chinese tradition holds the middle: both work through "sympathetic resonance."
- **Bhagavad Gita**: Karma yoga (act without attachment to results — competence reframed as spiritual discipline) vs. bhakti (total surrender to Krishna). The Gita teaches both paths.

### Theological Frameworks
- **Aquinas**: Primary causation (God) and secondary causation (creatures/human competence). In ordinary providence, God works through secondary causes. In extraordinary providence (miracles), God bypasses them. The criterion: miracles occur "for our salvation" when ordinary means cannot achieve the salvific end.
- **Austin Farrer**: "Double agency" — every act is simultaneously divine and human. What we call "miracle" is when divine agency becomes visible; "competence" is when it remains hidden. But double agency is always operative.
- **Reformed tradition**: "Ordinary means of grace" (Word, sacraments, trained preaching) vs. extraordinary means. God "has pleased to bind himself to the use of these means" — pushing toward competence and institutional excellence.

### The Restoration Synthesis
- **Ether 12:27**: "I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them." God *gives* weakness (like reducing Gideon's army). Weakness produces humility. Grace transforms weakness into strength. The weakness is designed, not accidental.
- **D&C 1:19**: "The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones."
- **Alma 37:6-7**: "By small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise." God works by means — but the means are deliberately humble.
- **The LDS lay ministry system**: The Gideon theology institutionalized. Members routinely serve in positions they lack professional qualifications for. The system operates below the threshold of professional competence not because competence is unavailable but because the theological point requires visible reliance on divine enablement.

## What the Dialectic Must Engage

1. The specific textual evidence from all three pairs — not abstract claims about "patterns" but the actual editorial choices Hardy identifies
2. Broader scriptural evidence for and against providential recurrence — the pattern appears across traditions, which cuts both ways (is it universal truth, or universal human tendency to construct this narrative?)
3. The epistemological question: can we distinguish "discovered patterns" from "constructed patterns" in historical narrative? Hayden White says no. Sternberg says yes.
4. The theological question: does it matter? If Mormon's craft surfaces genuine truth, is it less true for being crafted?
5. The implications for how we read all scripture — every scriptural text is edited, selected, arranged
6. The Francesca Murphy challenge: if God is truly free and persons are truly mysterious, can divine action be reduced to predictable patterns at all? Does the very concept of "providential recurrence" domesticate God?
7. The cross-traditional evidence: the competence/blessedness tension appears in every major religious tradition. Does this universality suggest it reflects something real about divine-human interaction, or that it reflects something real about human storytelling?
