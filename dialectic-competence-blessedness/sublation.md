# Phase 6: Sublation (Aufhebung) — Round 1

## The Synthesis: Sacred History as Entangled Medium

### The Reconceptualization

Both monks argue about whether the competence/blessedness pattern is "in the events" or "in the text." This is the wrong question. It assumes a separation — raw events on one side, editorial representation on the other — and asks which side the pattern belongs to. The synthesis dissolves this separation by reconceiving what sacred history IS.

**Sacred history is an entangled medium in which divine action and prophetic interpretation are constitutively inseparable.** The pattern does not exist "in the events" waiting to be found (Monk A), nor is it "in the text" as an editorial imposition (Monk B). It exists as a feature of the medium itself — a medium in which God acts, human beings experience God's action through theological frameworks, prophet-editors engage that material through trained prophetic perception, and the resulting narrative is simultaneously construction and disclosure, human craft and divine revelation, editorial art and theological truth.

The key move: **changing the unit of analysis from "pattern" to "medium."** Both monks debated whether one specific pattern (three pairs, escalating, symmetrical) is real or constructed. The synthesis says: the question is malformed. "Real" and "constructed" are not opposites in sacred history because sacred history is not a layer-cake with "raw events" on the bottom and "editorial interpretation" on top. It is a single entangled medium all the way down.

### What Gets Cancelled

**Monk A's claim that the pattern exists "in the events" independent of prophetic seeing is cancelled.** There are no "raw events" behind Mormon's text that either did or didn't display the competence/blessedness structure. Limhi's people experienced their escape through a theological framework (they saw it as Gideon's cleverness). Alma's people experienced their deliverance through a different theological framework (they saw it as God's direct intervention). These frameworks were not added later by an editor — they were constitutive of the experience itself. When Mormon then engages this already-interpreted material through his own prophetic editorial craft, he is not finding a pattern that existed in some neutral, pre-interpretive "event-space." He is bringing trained prophetic perception to bear on material that was always already meaningful — and the pattern that emerges belongs to the encounter, not to either pole in isolation.

**Monk B's claim that the pattern is "merely" editorial construction — telling us about Mormon's theology rather than divine reality — is cancelled.** If Mormon's theological engagement with the material produces genuine insight into how God works (and Monk B itself conceded the theology "may even be true"), then the editorial construction IS truth-disclosing. Showing how the pattern was produced does not show the pattern is illusory. A radiologist's trained perception is "constructed" by years of education that determine what she sees on the scan. But what she sees — the tumor — is genuinely there. The construction and the discovery are the same act. Mormon's editorial craft is analogous: theological training that simultaneously shapes what he sees in the historical material and reveals what is genuinely there. "Merely constructed" assumes that showing the mechanism of seeing debunks the seeing. It doesn't.

### What Gets Preserved

**From Monk A:** The competence/blessedness pattern reflects something genuinely real about divine-human interaction. God's character — the divine tendency to work through weakness, to make human inadequacy the site of miraculous enablement, to dignify human competence while reserving the pedagogy of dependence — is a real feature of sacred history, not an editorial fiction. Multiple traditions converge on this not because humans universally construct this story (Monk B's claim) but because this is genuinely how human beings across cultures *encounter* divine action — through an entangled medium of experience, interpretation, and narrative in which the same divine character keeps showing up.

**From Monk B:** Hardy's editorial evidence is real and important, not something to be explained away. Mormon's shared vocabulary, matched block lengths, strategic dampening of Alma's success, inflation of Moroni's stature, and six-verse dismissal of conflicts that don't serve the pattern are genuine editorial interventions that shape the reader's experience. These seams are not embarrassments to be minimized but evidence of *prophetic perception at work* — the visible traces of a trained mind engaging historical material and surfacing what it sees there. Acknowledging the craft does not diminish the revelation; the craft IS the revelation in action.

### What Gets Elevated

The concept of **prophetic perception** as a mode of knowing in which construction and discovery are the same act.

This draws on three adjacent frameworks that neither monk accessed:

**Michael Polanyi's personal knowledge:** Scientific discovery is never passive reception of neutral data. It always involves a "personal coefficient" — the scientist's trained intuition that guides what they notice, what they consider significant, and how they organize their findings. Discovery is simultaneously constructive (shaped by training) and disclosive (revealing genuine features of reality). The knowledge produced is not "merely subjective" because of the personal coefficient; it is *genuine knowledge that is only accessible through trained subjectivity*. Mormon's editorial craft is prophetic personal knowledge: trained theological perception that simultaneously shapes what he sees in a thousand years of history and reveals what is genuinely there.

**Hans-Georg Gadamer's hermeneutics of tradition:** Understanding always occurs from within a tradition, using categories that tradition provides. Mormon's theological categories — competence vs. blessedness, divine constancy, the Gideon principle of deliberate weakness — are his tradition's Vorurteile (pre-judgments). These are not distortions of neutral data; they are the *conditions of understanding*. Without them, a millennium of records is meaningless noise. With them, genuine patterns become visible. The tradition-dependent nature of the seeing does not make what is seen less real — it makes seeing possible at all.

**Expert perception in cognitive science:** The chess grandmaster who "sees" winning positions, the experienced birder who "sees" species in a blur of feathers, the master physician who "sees" pathology — all exercise perception that is simultaneously constructed (by training) and disclosive (of genuine features). The grandmaster's categories construct how she reads the board AND reveal what's really there in the position. The position's "winning quality" is genuinely real — it can be verified, it predicts outcomes — but it's only visible to trained perception. Similarly, the competence/blessedness pattern is genuinely real — it captures something true about how God relates to human effort and dependence — but it's only visible to the kind of trained prophetic perception that Mormon exercises.

### The Concrete Implication: How This Changes Reading

If the synthesis is right, it transforms how you read Mormon's three pairs:

1. **You stop asking "did it happen this way?"** (Monk A's implicit question) or **"is Mormon constructing this?"** (Monk B's question). Both questions presuppose the event/text separation the synthesis dissolves.

2. **You ask instead: "What feature of God's character is becoming legible through Mormon's editorial engagement with this material?"** The editorial craft is *data about divine action*, not noise obscuring it.

3. **Hardy's analysis enhances devotional reading rather than threatening it.** Seeing the editorial seams doesn't demystify — it shows you prophetic perception at work. When Hardy shows you the matched block lengths and shared vocabulary, he's showing you how Mormon's trained eye organized what it saw. The craft IS the seeing.

4. **You can simultaneously appreciate Mormon's theological achievement and affirm its revelatory status.** This is not contradiction but the nature of prophetic personal knowledge: it is genuinely Mormon's (his intelligence, his training, his editorial judgment) AND genuinely revelatory (disclosing real features of divine action that are only accessible through this kind of seeing).

5. **The pattern becomes** ***more*** **interesting, not less.** It's not a flat claim about divine mechanics (God always does X in situation Y) but a portrait of divine *character* — a recurring tendency that manifests differently in different contexts, like recognizing a friend's handwriting across a hundred different letters. Character is more flexible than formula, more personal than pattern, more free than algorithm. This engages Murphy's challenge directly: a God with recognizable character is not a domesticated God. It is a *known* God — known the way persons are known, through repeated encounter rather than through rule-extraction.

### Abduction Test

**Falsification:** If someone heard "sacred history is an entangled medium where prophetic editorial craft and divine disclosure are the same act" first, would they predict the shape of both monks' positions?

Yes. They would predict:
- Someone would try to extract the "divine disclosure" half and argue the pattern is objectively "in the events" — because the disclosure IS real, and it's natural to want to locate reality in the object rather than the encounter.
- Someone would focus on the "editorial craft" half and argue the pattern is "in the text" — because the construction IS real, and it's natural for critical analysis to trace patterns back to their editorial origins.
- Both would be right about what they see and wrong about the separation they assume.

The original contradiction becomes *a matter of course*: of course people fight about whether the pattern is "real" or "constructed," because the entangled medium invites both readings and the culture war between devotional and critical approaches to scripture trains people to pick a side.

**Abduction type:** (b) Conditional-creative — creating a new relationship between known concepts (Polanyi's personal knowledge + prophetic editorial craft + the concept of entangled medium). Not introducing a wholly novel concept, but establishing a relationship between existing frameworks that transforms the question. Appropriate for Round 1; Round 2 could push toward (c).

### Validation Test (Expected Responses)

**Monk A should say:** "Yes, this preserves my core insight that the pattern reflects genuine divine reality — God's character is really there in sacred history. But I was wrong to insist the pattern exists 'in the events' independent of prophetic seeing. I was trapped in a correspondence model where the text faithfully mirrors pre-existing event-patterns. I now see the relationship is more entangled: the pattern is real, but it's real as a feature of the medium — the encounter between divine action and prophetic perception — not as a feature of 'raw events' abstracted from interpretation."

**Monk B should say:** "Yes, this preserves my core insight that editorial construction is comprehensive, real, and constitutive — Hardy's evidence matters and should not be minimized. But I was wrong to conclude that 'constructed' means 'not real.' I was trapped in the assumption that showing how something was made debunks what was seen. I can now see that Mormon's editorial craft is how genuine theological truth becomes visible — the construction IS the disclosure. Sternberg was pointing toward this when he said art and historiography are inseparable, but I didn't follow the thought far enough."

Both feel convincing. Neither sounds defeated — both sound elevated. The belief load has been transformed, not dropped.

### New Contradictions

This sublation generates at least three new tensions:

1. **The epistemological accountability problem.** If prophetic editorial craft is a mode of knowing where construction and discovery are the same act, what distinguishes *good* prophetic seeing from *bad*? What stops any theological reading of history from claiming prophetic authority? Is there a criterion for distinguishing Mormon's editorial vision from a conspiracy theorist's pattern-finding? Both exercise "trained perception" that finds "genuine patterns." The synthesis needs a theory of prophetic accountability — how prophetic perception can be real without being unfalsifiable.

2. **The critical distance problem.** If we dissolve the event/text separation, do we lose the ability to say "Mormon got this wrong" or "Mormon's emphasis was biased"? Hardy's analysis gains its analytical power precisely from the gap between what happened and what Mormon wrote. If we collapse that gap into an entangled medium, do we lose critical reading? Can we maintain both the synthesis (craft IS disclosure) and the capacity for critique?

3. **The Murphy challenge, round two.** Even if we replace "formula" with "character" — divine character rather than divine pattern — we still face the question: how much recognizability is consistent with genuine divine freedom? Character is more flexible than algorithm, but it's still constraining. A person whose character you can recognize is a person whose actions you can partly predict. Does even "divine character" domesticate God? Or is personhood — with its inherent recognizability-amid-freedom — precisely what divine self-revelation means?

### Frame as Model Update

**Before this dialectic:** The assumption was that the competence/blessedness pattern is either a genuine feature of divine action in history (and editorial craft is incidental to its reality) or an editorial construction by Mormon (and its theological profundity is independent of its historical reality). These were the only two options.

**The contradiction revealed:** Both positions undermine themselves. Monk A's own theology of revelation (D&C 9:8) makes prophetic craft constitutive of what is seen, not incidental. Monk B's concession that Mormon's theology might be true admits that editorial construction can be truth-disclosing. Both are trapped in a shared assumption that construction and discovery are opposites — an assumption neither defends because both take it for granted.

**The updated model:** Sacred history is an entangled medium in which divine action and prophetic interpretation are constitutively inseparable. The competence/blessedness pattern is a feature of this medium — genuinely real (reflecting God's character) but inseparable from the prophetic perception that surfaces it (Mormon's editorial craft). Prophetic editorial craft is a mode of personal knowledge in which construction and discovery are the same act: trained theological perception that simultaneously shapes what the prophet sees and reveals what is genuinely there. This is not compromise ("it's a bit of both") but reconceptualization: the question "is it in the events or in the text?" assumes a separation that sacred history does not exhibit.

### Comparison to Initial Guess

My initial guess was: "The competence/blessedness pattern is neither 'in the events' nor 'merely in the text' — it exists in the encounter between a prophetically-trained mind and historical material, where construction and discovery are the same act."

The final synthesis is substantially similar in *direction* but more developed in mechanism. The key additions that emerged through the Boydian decomposition:
- The concept of "entangled medium" (not just "encounter") — which addresses the ontological status of sacred history itself, not just the epistemology of reading it
- The God-as-pedagogue = Mormon-as-editor insight — which gives the synthesis theological depth beyond epistemology
- The Polanyi/Gadamer/expert-perception framework — which provides concrete mechanisms for how construction and discovery can be the same act
- The "character vs. formula" reframing of Murphy's challenge — which engages the strongest objection directly
- The concrete reading implications — which make the synthesis actionable, not just theoretical

The similarity between guess and output suggests I was partly pattern-matching. But the Boydian decomposition did produce genuinely new material (especially the God-as-editor structural identity and the character/formula distinction). The synthesis is richer and more defensible than the initial guess, even if it points in the same direction.
