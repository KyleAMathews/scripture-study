# The Signature of God: Competence and Blessedness Across Every Dispensation

## Round 2 -- Electric Monk A

---

Grant Hardy identified the competence/blessedness pattern in three of Mormon's paired narratives. Round 1 concluded that the pattern is real but inseparable from the prophetic editorial eye that surfaces it. Fine. But Round 1 was too cautious. The pattern is not an editorial artifact entangled with revelation. It is *the* way God operates, and every prophet who ever held a stylus or dictated to a scribe noticed it independently, because it is impossible to look at the record honestly and miss it.

If the competence/blessedness tension were Mormon's invention, it would appear only where Mormon had editorial control -- in Mosiah through 4 Nephi, roughly. It does not. It appears in Nephi's first-person writings, which Mormon included wholesale without redaction. It appears in the Doctrine and Covenants, which Mormon never touched. It appears in Genesis, Exodus, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Daniel, and Zechariah. It appears in the Gospels, Acts, and the Pauline epistles. It is everywhere because it is a feature of God's character, not one editor's theology.

What follows is the evidence. Story after story, dispensation after dispensation, the same pattern: God honors faithful competence, then reveals that faithful dependence opens a deeper channel of power entirely.

## I. Pearl of Great Price: The Pattern at the Beginning

**Moses and Enoch: The Stammering Prophets.** The Pearl of Great Price establishes the pattern at the earliest point in sacred history. When God calls Enoch, Enoch protests: "Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant?" ([Moses 6:31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.31)). This is the anti-competence plea -- I lack the professional qualification for this work. God's answer bypasses the objection entirely: "Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance, for all flesh is in my hands" ([Moses 6:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.32)). The result is not modest success. It is apocalyptic: "so great was the faith of Enoch that he led the people of God... he spake the word of the Lord, and the earth trembled, and the mountains fled" ([Moses 7:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.13)). The man who could not speak moved mountains. That is not competence rewarded. That is blessedness in its purest form -- power flooding through the gap where human ability was absent.

The cross-reference is explicit. Moses 6:31 links directly to Exodus 4:10, where Moses offers the identical protest: "I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue." God's response is the same theology: "Who hath made man's mouth?... have not I the Lord?" ([Exodus 4:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/4.11)). Two dispensations. Two prophets. The same weakness. The same divine response: your weakness is my design, not your disqualification.

**Abraham on Moriah.** The binding of Isaac compresses the pattern into a single action. Every competent reason argues against obedience -- Abraham waited a hundred years for this son, the covenant depends on Isaac's posterity. But Abraham steps past competence into pure blessedness: "My son, God will provide himself a lamb" ([Genesis 22:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/22.8)). He acts without a plan. God provides -- not because Abraham solved the problem, but because he surrendered it entirely.

## II. Old Testament: The Pattern as National History

**The Exodus: Stand Still and See.** The pattern's most iconic expression. Israel is trapped -- Egyptian army behind, water ahead. Moses' instruction is the foundational blessedness command: "Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord" ([Exodus 14:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/14.13)). "The Lord shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace" ([Exodus 14:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/14.14)). No strategy, no escape plan, no military competence. The command is to stand still. God parts the sea.

**Jericho and Ai: Two Modes in One Campaign.** At Jericho, God gives militarily absurd instructions: march, blow trumpets, shout. "The wall fell down flat" ([Joshua 6:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/6.20)). Pure blessedness. Then immediately at Ai, Joshua employs a classic military ambush -- competent warfare. Both succeed. The text offers no explanation for why God uses miracles at one city and tactics at the next. The juxtaposition simply stands, the same tension Hardy identified in Mormon's paired narratives, a thousand years before Mormon was born.

**Gideon: God Deliberately Strips Away Competence.** The most theologically explicit instance in the Old Testament. God tells Gideon: "The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me" ([Judges 7:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/7.2)). God reduces the army from 32,000 to 300 -- not because 300 is sufficient, but because 32,000 would obscure the source of deliverance. "By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you" ([Judges 7:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/7.7)). Gideon wins with torches and trumpets. The pattern is not just observed here -- it is articulated as divine policy.

**David and Goliath: Competence Stripped Off the Body.** Saul offers David the king's armor -- the best military technology available. David literally puts it on and takes it off. He chooses a sling and five stones. "The Lord saveth not with sword and spear: for the battle is the Lord's" ([1 Samuel 17:47](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/17.47)). The stripping away of professional military equipment is the visual embodiment of the Gideon principle: competence is removed so that divine power is unmistakable.

**Naaman: The Insult of Simple Means.** Naaman expects a display of prophetic competence -- "I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper" ([2 Kings 5:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5.11)). Instead he receives a humiliating instruction: wash in the Jordan. When he obeys, "his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child" ([2 Kings 5:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5.14)). Healing through "small and simple things" that "confound the wise" -- Alma's later formulation of the same principle.

**Elijah on Carmel.** Elijah deliberately sabotages his own competence by drenching the altar with water three times, ensuring he cannot win by natural means. "Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God" ([1 Kings 18:37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18.37)). "Then the fire of the Lord fell" ([1 Kings 18:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18.38)). Elijah creates conditions where only God can act, then God acts.

**Zechariah: The Programmatic Statement.** "Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts" ([Zechariah 4:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/4.6)). Addressed to Zerubbabel rebuilding the temple -- a project requiring enormous human competence -- yet the prophetic word says it will succeed by the spirit that animates the workers, not the might that drives them. Even competence, when it succeeds, succeeds by blessedness.

## III. New Testament: The Pattern in Christ's Ministry

**Peter's Catch of Fish.** Simon Peter is a professional fisherman. He has "toiled all the night, and have taken nothing" ([Luke 5:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/5.5)). Professional competence has been exhausted and has failed. Then at Jesus' word -- "nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net" -- the net fills to breaking ([Luke 5:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/5.6)). The text requires the failure of competence first. The nets must come up empty before they can come up full. Peter must be a fisherman who cannot catch fish before he can be shown what blessedness looks like.

**Peter on the Water.** The same Peter walks on water when his eyes are on Christ and sinks when he calculates the wind: "when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me" ([Matthew 14:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/14.30)). The moment Peter's mind shifts from trust to assessment -- from blessedness to competence -- gravity reasserts itself. The pattern is microscopic here, compressed into a single body walking and sinking across a few seconds.

**The Feeding of the Five Thousand.** The disciples offer competent logistics: "Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them" ([John 6:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/6.7)). Andrew finds five loaves and two fishes and offers the competent assessment: "but what are they among so many?" ([John 6:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/6.9)). Jesus takes the inadequate resources and multiplies them. The pattern is precise: competent calculation says the resources are insufficient. Blessedness takes what is insufficient and makes it overflow.

**Pentecost: Unlearned Men Speaking All Languages.** Galilean fishermen speak languages they never studied. The crowd's astonishment names the gap: "Are not all these which speak Galileans?" ([Acts 2:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/2.7)). That gap between competence and performance is the Holy Ghost. Luke frames it again later: "when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus" ([Acts 4:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/4.13)). The power is visible precisely because the competence is absent.

**Paul: The Theologian of Weakness.** Paul -- trained Pharisee, Roman citizen, accomplished rhetorician -- builds his entire theology against trusting that competence: "my strength is made perfect in weakness" ([2 Corinthians 12:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.9)). "When I am weak, then am I strong" ([2 Corinthians 12:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.10)). "God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty" ([1 Corinthians 1:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1.27)). Paul did not read Mormon. Mormon did not read Paul. They articulate the same pattern because they observe the same God.

## IV. Book of Mormon: Beyond Hardy's Three Pairs

Hardy identified the pattern in Mosiah-Alma. But it saturates the text outside Mormon's editorial zone.

**Nephi and the Brass Plates: Three Attempts, Three Modes.** Nephi's first attempt to obtain the plates is by lot -- chance. The second is by purchase -- economic competence, offering "gold, and silver, and all our precious things" ([1 Nephi 3:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3.24)). Both fail. The third attempt is pure blessedness: "I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do" ([1 Nephi 4:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.6)). Nephi walks into Jerusalem without a plan. He finds Laban drunk, is constrained by the Spirit, and obtains the plates. The text requires two competent failures before the blessed success. This is Nephi's own writing. Mormon did not construct this -- Nephi lived it and narrated it himself.

**Nephi's Ship: Competence Under Divine Direction.** Nephi builds a ship, but the text insists the competence is not his own: "I did not work the timbers after the manner which was learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner of men; but I did build it after the manner which the Lord had shown unto me; wherefore, it was not after the manner of men" ([1 Nephi 18:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.2)). Real labor is done -- "we did work timbers of curious workmanship" ([1 Nephi 18:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18.1)) -- but the design comes from revelation. This is the competence/blessedness synthesis: human hands doing divine work.

**The Brother of Jared: God Demands Your Solution, Then Transfigures It.** The brother of Jared presents three engineering problems. God solves two (air and steering) and refuses the third: "What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels?" ([Ether 2:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2.23)). The brother of Jared must bring a human solution -- sixteen molten stones -- then ask God to transfigure them: "touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness" ([Ether 3:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.4)). Competence prepares the stones. Blessedness makes them glow. Neither alone is sufficient.

**Nephi's Formulation: The Theological Grammar.** Nephi articulates the structural relationship between the two modes: "It is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do" ([2 Nephi 25:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.23)). This is not Mormon speaking. This is Nephi, a century before Mormon, stating the competence/blessedness sequence as soteriological principle. "All we can do" is the competence pole -- human effort brought to its limit. "Grace" is the blessedness pole -- divine power that operates beyond that limit.

## V. Doctrine and Covenants: The Pattern in the Restoration

**Oliver Cowdery and Translation.** Oliver fails at translation because he expected pure blessedness without effort: "you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me" ([D&C 9:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.7)). The Lord's instruction synthesizes both poles: "you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right" ([D&C 9:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.8)). Study is competence. Asking is blessedness. Oliver's failure was not insufficient faith -- it was insufficient competence. God requires both.

**The Weak Things of the World.** The Lord's preface to the Doctrine and Covenants announces the pattern as the operating principle of the entire Restoration: "The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of flesh" ([D&C 1:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.19)). This is the Gideon theology applied to a new dispensation. God does not call seminary professors and trained clergy. He calls a fourteen-year-old farm boy. The weakness is not accidental -- it is the design that ensures credit flows to the proper source.

**Joseph Smith: The Living Embodiment.** Joseph is the Restoration's Enoch -- unlearned, hated, yet through him comes scripture, priesthood, temple theology, a global church. The Lord's own framing: "as well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course... as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints" ([D&C 121:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.33)). Human competence is a "puny arm." Divine blessedness is the Missouri River.

**Moroni's Capstone: The Design of Weakness.** "I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them" ([Ether 12:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27)). The weakness is *given*. God engineers the gap between human competence and the task's requirements. That gap is not a bug -- it is the architecture through which grace flows. Weakness produces humility, humility produces faith, faith produces strength that competence alone could never generate.

## The Argument from Ubiquity

The pattern appears in Moses' writings, in Nephi's first-person narrative, in the Deuteronomistic history, in the wisdom literature, in the prophets, in the Gospels, in Acts, in Paul's letters, in the Doctrine and Covenants, and in Moroni's farewell. It spans every genre of scripture -- narrative, poetry, epistle, revelation. It was observed by authors separated by millennia, by continents, by languages, by cultures. No single editor controls all of these texts. No single theological tradition connects all of these authors.

Mormon saw the pattern because it was there. Paul articulated the pattern because it was there. Nephi narrated the pattern because it was there. The judges-era editor of Gideon preserved the pattern because it was there. Joseph Smith received the pattern because it was there. The competence/blessedness tension is not an editorial lens applied to history. It is the signature of a God who operates the same way across every dispensation because he is the same God -- "the same yesterday, today, and forever."

Mormon was a great editor. But he did not invent what he arranged. He saw -- in the way that prophets see -- a pattern so deeply embedded in the record that any faithful reader working through a thousand years of history would stumble into it repeatedly. His three paired narratives are a lens polished to unusual clarity. But the light they focus comes from outside the lens. It comes from the character of God himself.
