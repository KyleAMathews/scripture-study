# The Fruits of the True Church: What Scripture Says We Should See

Christ gave His disciples a simple test: "By their fruits ye shall know them" ([Matthew 7:16](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/Matthew%207.16.md)). This was not abstract theology but practical instruction. A tree is known by its fruit. A prophet is known by his works. And a church—Christ's church—should be known by what it produces in the lives of its members and in the world.

If we take this test seriously, we must ask: what fruits does scripture say the true church should bear? The prophets across dispensations have answered this question with remarkable consistency.

## The Supreme Fruit: Charity

Every scriptural discussion of spiritual fruits returns to the same center: charity, the pure love of Christ.

Paul's famous treatise in 1 Corinthians defines it: "Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil" ([1 Corinthians 13:4-5](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/1%20Corinthians%2013.4.md)). Mormon, writing centuries later on another continent, used nearly identical language: "Charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things" ([Moroni 7:45](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Moroni%207.45.md)).

Both conclude with the same verdict. Paul: "The greatest of these is charity" ([1 Corinthians 13:13](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/1%20Corinthians%2013.13.md)). Mormon: "If ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth" ([Moroni 7:46](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Moroni%207.46.md)).

Jesus simplified it further: "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another" ([John 13:35](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/John%2013.35.md)). Not by their doctrines, not by their rituals, not by their buildings—but by their love.

## The Fruits of the Spirit

Paul enumerated what the Spirit produces in those who follow it: "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance" ([Galatians 5:22-23](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/Galatians%205.22.md)). These are not optional extras for the spiritually advanced. They are the evidence of the Spirit's presence. Where these fruits are absent, we must question whether the Spirit is present at all.

Alma taught the same principle: "See that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always abound in good works" ([Alma 7:24](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Alma%207.24.md)). The sequence matters. Faith, hope, and charity are the roots; good works are the inevitable fruit. You cannot have the one without the other.

## The 4 Nephi Standard

Perhaps nowhere in scripture do we see a clearer picture of what a Zion church looks like than in 4 Nephi. After Christ's visit to the Nephites, the people were converted—truly converted—and the results were immediate and dramatic.

"There were no contentions and disputations among them, and every man did deal justly one with another" ([4 Nephi 1:2](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/4%20Nephi%201.2.md)).

"They had all things common among them; therefore there were not rich and poor, bond and free, but they were all made free, and partakers of the heavenly gift" ([4 Nephi 1:3](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/4%20Nephi%201.3.md)).

"There was no contention in the land, because of the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people" ([4 Nephi 1:15](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/4%20Nephi%201.15.md)).

"There were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God" ([4 Nephi 1:17](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/4%20Nephi%201.17.md)).

This was not utopian fantasy. It was a historical reality that lasted nearly two hundred years. The text is specific: no contention, no economic disparity, no tribal divisions, no crime. The cause was equally specific: "the love of God which did dwell in the hearts of the people."

The early Christian church in Jerusalem showed the same pattern: "All that believed were together, and had all things common; and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need" ([Acts 2:44-45](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/Acts%202.44.md)).

## Care for the Poor

One of the most consistent fruits the prophets identify is care for the vulnerable. This is not peripheral to the gospel; it is central to it.

King Benjamin was explicit: "For the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God—I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants" ([Mosiah 4:26](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Mosiah%204.26.md)).

Note the stakes: retaining a remission of sins depends on caring for the poor. This is not optional charity. It is the fruit by which we demonstrate our conversion is real.

Alma organized the church at the waters of Mormon with the same priority: "The people of the church should impart of their substance, every one according to that which he had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and of him that had but little, but little should be required; and to him that had not should be given" ([Mosiah 18:27](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Mosiah%2018.27.md)).

Jacob was characteristically direct: "Think of your brethren like unto yourselves, and be familiar with all and free with your substance, that they may be rich like unto you" ([Jacob 2:17](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Jacob%202.17.md)).

## Unity

The prophets consistently describe the true church as unified—not through conformity of opinion but through bonds of love.

Alma commanded "that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another" ([Mosiah 18:21](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Mosiah%2018.21.md)).

The Lord defined Zion simply: "This is Zion—the pure in heart" ([D&C 97:21](standard-works-vault/Doctrine%20and%20Covenants/D&C%2097.21.md)). Purity of heart, not purity of bloodline or geography. The early saints at Jerusalem "continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers" ([Acts 2:42](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/Acts%202.42.md)). Doctrine, fellowship, sacrament, prayer—the four pillars of a unified community.

## The Mighty Change

True conversion produces visible transformation. The people of King Benjamin experienced this: "A mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually" ([Mosiah 5:2](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Mosiah%205.2.md)).

Alma asked his people to examine themselves: "Have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?" ([Alma 5:14](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Alma%205.14.md)). The mighty change is not metaphorical. It produces real effects—a new disposition, a new countenance, a new way of being in the world.

Mormon described what baptism should produce: "After they had been received unto baptism, and were wrought upon and cleansed by the power of the Holy Ghost, they were numbered among the people of the church of Christ; and their names were taken, that they might be remembered and nourished by the good word of God, to keep them in the right way, to keep them continually watchful unto prayer, relying alone upon the merits of Christ" ([Moroni 6:4](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Moroni%206.4.md)).

## Spiritual Gifts

The true church should manifest spiritual gifts. Moroni listed them: wisdom, knowledge, exceedingly great faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, beholding angels, tongues, and interpretation of tongues ([Moroni 10:9-16](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Moroni%2010.9.md)). Paul gave a similar list in 1 Corinthians 12. The Doctrine and Covenants expands on both in section 46.

Jesus promised specific signs would follow believers: "In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues... they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover" ([Mark 16:17-18](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/Mark%2016.17.md)).

Moroni made a critical point about these gifts: they "never will be done away, even as long as the world shall stand, only according to the unbelief of the children of men" ([Moroni 10:19](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/Moroni%2010.19.md)). The gifts do not cease because God withdraws them. They cease because unbelief blocks them. A church without spiritual gifts is a church without faith—or at least, without the kind of faith that moves mountains.

The 4 Nephi record confirms this: "There were great and marvelous works wrought by the disciples of Jesus, insomuch that they did heal the sick, and raise the dead, and cause the lame to walk, and the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear; and all manner of miracles did they work among the children of men; and in nothing did they work miracles save it were in the name of Jesus" ([4 Nephi 1:5](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/4%20Nephi%201.5.md)).

## The Purpose of Gifts

The Lord clarified why gifts are given: "They are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do; that all may be benefited that seek or that ask of me" ([D&C 46:9](standard-works-vault/Doctrine%20and%20Covenants/D&C%2046.9.md)).

Gifts are not for show. They are not for personal aggrandizement. They are for the benefit of others—for building up the body of Christ and blessing those in need. "All these gifts come from God, for the benefit of the children of God" ([D&C 46:26](standard-works-vault/Doctrine%20and%20Covenants/D&C%2046.26.md)).

## The Test Applied

If we take seriously Christ's instruction to judge by fruits, the scriptures give us clear criteria:

1. **Charity**: Do members love one another? Is their love patient, kind, not easily provoked? Do they seek each other's good rather than their own?

2. **Fruits of the Spirit**: Is there love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance? Or are there contention, anger, envy, and pride?

3. **Economic justice**: Are there poor among them? Do those with abundance share with those in need? Do they think of their brethren as themselves?

4. **Unity**: Are hearts knit together? Is there contention and disputation, or do they deal justly with one another?

5. **Transformation**: Are members experiencing the mighty change of heart? Do they have a new disposition toward good?

6. **Spiritual gifts**: Are the gifts of the Spirit manifest? Is there prophecy, healing, wisdom, knowledge? Or has unbelief driven these away?

These are not arbitrary standards imposed from outside. They are the marks the prophets themselves identified as evidence of Christ's church and Christ's people.

## A Sobering Standard

The 4 Nephi standard is particularly sobering. That community lasted two hundred years with no poor, no contention, no crime, no divisions—because the love of God dwelt in their hearts. We cannot read that account and feel comfortable with anything less.

Mormon recorded what ended their Zion: "There began to be among them those who were lifted up in pride, such as the wearing of costly apparel, and all manner of fine pearls, and of the fine things of the world. And from that time forth they did have their goods and their substance no more common among them. And they began to be divided into classes" ([4 Nephi 1:24-26](standard-works-vault/Book%20of%20Mormon/4%20Nephi%201.24.md)).

Pride. Costly apparel. Class divisions. The end of economic sharing. These were the fruits of apostasy—the opposite fruits that revealed the love of God had departed from their hearts.

## Conclusion

The test is simple, even if living it is hard. By their fruits ye shall know them. A tree is known by its fruit. A church is known by what it produces.

The prophets have told us what to look for: charity that suffers long and is kind, the fruits of the Spirit manifest in daily life, no poor among us, hearts knit in unity, the mighty change working in souls, and spiritual gifts flowing freely for the benefit of all.

These are not optional features of an advanced church. They are the baseline. They are what Christ's gospel produces when it truly takes root in human hearts.

Where these fruits abound, Christ's Spirit is present. Where they are absent, we must ask hard questions about whether we have truly planted the seed or merely gone through the motions of planting.

"Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them" ([Matthew 7:20](standard-works-vault/New%20Testament/Matthew%207.20.md)).
