# Romantic Love in Scripture: A Valentine's Day Reflection

The scriptures are sometimes viewed as austere texts concerned primarily with commandments, covenants, and cosmic redemption. But woven throughout the canon is a surprising celebration of romantic love—the deep, passionate, embodied love between partners. More than that, the scriptures offer practical wisdom on sustaining love through time, deepening it through trials, and cultivating the qualities that transform infatuation into enduring devotion.

As Valentine's Day invites reflection on matters of the heart, these ancient texts offer timeless wisdom about both the nature and the nurture of romantic love.

## Part One: The Celebration of Love

### The Song of Solomon: Scripture's Love Poetry

The most striking celebration of romantic love in all scripture is the Song of Solomon—eight chapters of unabashed love poetry between two lovers. Its inclusion in the biblical canon has puzzled some readers expecting only theological discourse, yet its presence testifies that romantic love is worthy of scriptural attention.

The poetry captures the intoxication of mutual desire:

> "My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away." ([Song of Solomon 2:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/song/2.10))

> "Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee." ([Song of Solomon 4:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/song/4.7))

The lovers express mutual belonging—not possession, but joyful surrender to one another:

> "My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies." ([Song of Solomon 2:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/song/2.16))

And the Song reaches its theological apex in chapter 8, where romantic love is elevated to cosmic significance:

> "Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death... Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned." ([Song of Solomon 8:6-7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/song/8.6))

Love is "strong as death"—the two great undefeatable forces of human experience. No flood can drown it; no fortune can purchase it. This is not sentimental romanticism but a profound declaration: authentic love transcends economics, survives catastrophe, and rivals mortality itself in power.

### Love Stories in Genesis

The patriarchal narratives are anchored by love stories that have resonated across millennia.

**Jacob and Rachel** present perhaps the most romantic verse in all of Genesis:

> "And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her." ([Genesis 29:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/29.20))

Seven years of labor felt like mere days because of love. This reversal of time's weight captures something true about romantic love: it transforms drudgery into devotion, burden into privilege. Jacob's love made years feel like days; time bends before genuine affection.

**Isaac and Rebekah** offer a quieter but equally touching portrait:

> "And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death." ([Genesis 24:67](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/24.67))

Here romantic love serves as comfort in grief. The connection between Isaac and Rebekah didn't merely add joy to his life—it healed a wound. Love as comfort, love as restoration, love as the presence that makes loss bearable.

## Part Two: Sustaining Love Through Time

The scriptures are equally concerned with how love endures. The initial spark of attraction is celebrated, but so is the long faithfulness of decades together.

### "The Wife of Thy Youth"

A recurring scriptural phrase captures the vision of love that lasts: "the wife of thy youth." This isn't mere nostalgia but a command to sustain the love that began when you were young together.

Proverbs offers remarkably direct counsel:

> "Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well... Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love." ([Proverbs 5:15-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/5.15))

The imagery is striking: find satisfaction in your own marriage. Don't seek fulfillment elsewhere. Be "ravished always"—not just in the honeymoon phase, but continuously through the years. The word "always" does heavy lifting here: this isn't permission to let passion fade, but a call to cultivate ongoing delight.

Malachi adds covenantal weight:

> "The Lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant." ([Malachi 2:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/2.14))

Note the language: "companion" and "wife of thy covenant." Marriage is not merely a social arrangement but a witnessed covenant before God. The spouse is a companion—an equal partner in the journey. Betrayal of this covenant is "treachery," a word with moral gravity.

### The Wisdom of Companionship

Ecclesiastes offers a beautiful meditation on why partnership matters:

> "Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him up." ([Ecclesiastes 4:9-10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/4.9))

This is the practical wisdom of companionship: mutual support through life's inevitable falls. Love isn't just about passion; it's about having someone who lifts you when you stumble. The vulnerability of solitude—"woe to him that is alone when he falleth"—makes the gift of partnership all the more precious.

The same book counsels:

> "Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life... for that is thy portion in this life." ([Ecclesiastes 9:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/9.9))

Your spouse is your "portion"—your blessing, your inheritance in this life. The counsel is to live *joyfully* together, not merely to endure marriage but to find gladness in it.

## Part Three: The Character of Lasting Love

What qualities sustain love over decades? The scriptures offer a detailed portrait.

### The Anatomy of Love: 1 Corinthians 13

Paul's famous chapter on charity is often read at weddings, and for good reason—it describes the character of love that endures:

> "Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. Charity never faileth." ([1 Corinthians 13:4-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.4))

Each phrase is a discipline for marriage:
- **Suffereth long**: patience through difficult seasons
- **Is kind**: active gentleness, not just the absence of cruelty
- **Envieth not**: rejoicing in your spouse's successes rather than competing
- **Vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up**: humility that doesn't need to win arguments
- **Seeketh not her own**: selflessness that prioritizes the other
- **Is not easily provoked**: emotional regulation, not taking offense quickly
- **Thinketh no evil**: choosing charitable interpretations of your spouse's actions
- **Beareth all things, endureth all things**: commitment that weathers storms

This is love as a practice, not just a feeling—a set of choices made daily.

### Kindness, Forgiveness, and Forbearance

Colossians elaborates on the relational virtues:

> "Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness." ([Colossians 3:12-14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/3.12))

The instruction to "forbear" is crucial. Forbearance means bearing with someone's faults—not ignoring them, but choosing to love despite them. Every long marriage requires forbearance; no spouse is perfect. The standard for forgiveness is high: "as Christ forgave you." This is not grudging tolerance but genuine release.

Paul then adds a specific warning to husbands:

> "Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them." ([Colossians 3:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/3.19))

Bitterness is the quiet killer of marriages—resentments nursed over years, grievances catalogued and held. The command is direct: don't let bitterness take root.

---

## Part Four: The Practice of Love

### Communication and Conflict

Ephesians offers practical counsel on handling conflict:

> "Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath." ([Ephesians 4:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/4.26))

Anger itself is acknowledged as inevitable—"be ye angry" accepts that conflicts arise. But the instruction is to resolve them quickly, before the day ends. Don't let disputes fester overnight. Don't accumulate grievances.

The passage continues:

> "Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you." ([Ephesians 4:31-32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/4.31))

Note what must be "put away": bitterness, wrath, clamour (loud arguing), evil speaking (harsh words). What replaces them: kindness, tenderheartedness, forgiveness. This is a complete communication ethic for marriage.

### Dwelling with Understanding

Peter offers counsel that applies to any partnership:

> "Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered." ([1 Peter 3:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-pet/3.7))

"Dwell with them according to knowledge" is profound counsel. It means understanding your spouse—learning their needs, their fears, their hopes, the particular ways they feel loved. Generic love is not enough; specific, informed, personalized love is required.

The phrase "heirs together" emphasizes partnership and equality in the things that matter most. And the warning is striking: if you don't treat your spouse with honor and understanding, your prayers will be hindered. The quality of your marriage affects your relationship with God.

## Part Five: Covenant Loyalty

### Ruth's Model of Devotion

Though spoken to a mother-in-law rather than a spouse, Ruth's words have become a model for covenant loyalty in marriage:

> "Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God." ([Ruth 1:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ruth/1.16))

This is the structure of covenant love: complete identification with the other person. Your destination becomes my destination. Your people become my people. Your God becomes my God. There's no hedging, no escape clause, no partial commitment.

### Hosea: Faithful Love Despite Unfaithfulness

The prophet Hosea was commanded to marry a woman who would be unfaithful to him—a living parable of God's relationship with Israel. Yet even in this painful situation, the model is continued faithfulness:

> "I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness." ([Hosea 2:19-20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hosea/2.19))

The repetition of "I will betroth thee unto me" emphasizes renewed commitment. The terms of this betrothal—righteousness, lovingkindness, mercies, faithfulness—describe the character of God's love and model the character our love should aspire to.

## Part Six: The Qualities That Deepen Love

### D&C 121: Principles for Any Relationship

Though originally about priesthood leadership, the principles in D&C 121 have long been applied to marriage. They describe how influence should be maintained in any relationship:

> "No power or influence can or ought to be maintained... only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; by kindness, and pure knowledge, without hypocrisy, and without guile." ([D&C 121:41-42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41))

Each quality is a discipline for marriage:

- **Persuasion**: not coercion, manipulation, or force—but patient convincing
- **Long-suffering**: endurance through difficult seasons
- **Gentleness and meekness**: soft responses rather than harsh ones
- **Love unfeigned**: genuine affection, not performance or pretense
- **Kindness**: active goodness toward your spouse
- **Pure knowledge**: understanding your spouse deeply and accurately
- **Without hypocrisy and without guile**: authenticity and honesty

The opposite of each quality—coercion, impatience, harshness, pretense, unkindness, ignorance, manipulation—describes the behaviors that erode marriage.

### Sacrificial Love: The Highest Standard

Paul sets the ultimate standard for marital love:

> "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it." ([Ephesians 5:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/5.25))

> "So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself." ([Ephesians 5:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/5.28))

Christ's love for the church meant complete self-giving—holding nothing back, sacrificing everything for the beloved's good. This is the pattern: not love that calculates what it will receive in return, but love that gives itself.

The second verse adds another dimension: loving your spouse as your own body. You don't neglect your own needs; you shouldn't neglect your spouse's. Their wellbeing and yours are intertwined.

## Part Seven: The Eternal Dimension

### Wholehearted Devotion

The Doctrine and Covenants provides perhaps the most direct commandment about romantic devotion:

> "Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else." ([D&C 42:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.22))

Note the totality: "with all thy heart." Not partial affection divided among competing loyalties, but wholehearted love directed completely toward one's spouse. And "cleave"—that ancient word meaning to cling to, to be bonded inseparably.

### One Flesh

Genesis establishes the foundational vision:

> "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh." ([Genesis 2:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/2.24))

"One flesh" is the goal—not two people maintaining separate lives who happen to cohabitate, but genuine union. This requires leaving other attachments (even parents) to prioritize the marriage bond.

### Marriage as Eternal Covenant

Latter-day revelation places marriage at the center of eternal life. D&C 131 teaches that celestial marriage is essential to the highest degree of the celestial kingdom. D&C 132 elaborates that marriages sealed by proper authority continue beyond mortality—couples become "heirs" together of eternal life.

This theological claim transforms how Latter-day Saints understand romantic love: not as a temporary earthly pleasure but as a relationship with eternal trajectory and divine significance. The love cultivated here continues there.

## A Valentine's Meditation

As Valentine's Day arrives with its hearts and flowers, these ancient texts invite deeper reflection than greeting-card sentiments allow.

The scriptures don't dismiss romantic love as worldly distraction or inferior to spiritual concerns. Instead, they celebrate it as something "strong as death," worthy of seven years' labor, capable of healing grief, modeled on Christ's own self-giving, and commanded to be offered with the whole heart.

But celebration is only the beginning. The scriptures are equally concerned with the *disciplines* of love:

- **Faithfulness over time**: returning always to "the wife of thy youth"
- **Forbearance**: bearing with faults, forgiving as Christ forgave
- **Communication**: resolving conflicts before the sun sets, putting away bitterness and clamour
- **Understanding**: dwelling with knowledge, learning what your spouse specifically needs
- **Honor**: treating your partner as an equal heir of grace
- **Gentleness**: persuasion rather than coercion, meekness rather than harshness
- **Authenticity**: love unfeigned, without hypocrisy or guile
- **Sacrifice**: giving yourself as Christ gave himself

Perhaps the truest Valentine's message from scripture is this: love deeply, love completely, and then *practice* that love daily through patience, kindness, forgiveness, and understanding. Recognize in romantic devotion not just a feeling to enjoy but a discipline to cultivate—and in that cultivation, a glimpse of something eternal.
