# Romantic Love in Scripture: A Valentine's Day Reflection

The scriptures are sometimes viewed as austere texts concerned primarily with commandments, covenants, and cosmic redemption. But woven throughout the canon is a surprising celebration of romantic love—the deep, passionate, embodied love between partners. As Valentine's Day invites reflection on matters of the heart, these ancient texts offer timeless wisdom about the nature and sanctity of romantic love.

## The Song of Solomon: Scripture's Love Poetry

The most striking celebration of romantic love in all scripture is the Song of Solomon—eight chapters of unabashed love poetry between two lovers. Its inclusion in the biblical canon has puzzled some readers expecting only theological discourse, yet its presence testifies that romantic love is worthy of scriptural attention.

The poetry captures the intoxication of mutual desire:

> "My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away." ([Song of Solomon 2:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/song/2.10))

> "Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee." ([Song of Solomon 4:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/song/4.7))

The lovers express mutual belonging—not possession, but joyful surrender to one another:

> "My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies." ([Song of Solomon 2:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/song/2.16))

And the Song reaches its theological apex in chapter 8, where romantic love is elevated to cosmic significance:

> "Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death... Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned." ([Song of Solomon 8:6-7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/song/8.6))

Love is "strong as death"—the two great undefeatable forces of human experience. No flood can drown it; no fortune can purchase it. This is not sentimental romanticism but a profound declaration: authentic love transcends economics, survives catastrophe, and rivals mortality itself in power.

## Love Stories in Genesis

The patriarchal narratives are anchored by love stories that have resonated across millennia.

**Jacob and Rachel** present perhaps the most romantic verse in all of Genesis:

> "And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her." ([Genesis 29:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/29.20))

Seven years of labor felt like mere days because of love. This reversal of time's weight captures something true about romantic love: it transforms drudgery into devotion, burden into privilege. Jacob's love made years feel like days; time bends before genuine affection.

**Isaac and Rebekah** offer a quieter but equally touching portrait:

> "And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother's death." ([Genesis 24:67](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/24.67))

Here romantic love serves as comfort in grief. The connection between Isaac and Rebekah didn't merely add joy to his life—it healed a wound. Love as comfort, love as restoration, love as the presence that makes loss bearable.

## New Testament: Love as Self-Giving

Paul's letter to the Ephesians elevates marital love to the highest standard imaginable:

> "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it." ([Ephesians 5:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/5.25))

The standard is not mere affection but sacrificial self-giving. Christ's love for the church meant offering everything, holding nothing back. This is the pattern Paul holds up for romantic love: complete, unreserved, willing to sacrifice for the beloved's good.

## Latter-day Revelation: Wholehearted Love and Eternal Marriage

The Doctrine and Covenants provides perhaps the most direct commandment about romantic devotion:

> "Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else." ([D&C 42:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42.22))

Note the totality: "with all thy heart." Not partial affection divided among competing loyalties, but wholehearted love directed completely toward one's spouse. And "cleave"—that ancient word meaning to cling to, to be bonded inseparably. The romantic relationship takes priority; other attachments, however legitimate, do not compete with this central devotion.

Latter-day revelation also places marriage at the center of eternal life, teaching that the covenant of marriage continues beyond mortality. This theological claim transforms how Latter-day Saints understand romantic love: not as a temporary earthly pleasure but as a relationship with eternal trajectory and divine significance.

## What Scripture Teaches About Romantic Love

Drawing these passages together, several themes emerge:

1. **Romantic love is worthy of celebration.** The Song of Solomon's inclusion in scripture validates that passionate human love deserves poetic attention and religious consideration.

2. **Love transforms time and burden.** Jacob's years of labor felt like days. Genuine love changes our experience of sacrifice—what we do for those we love doesn't feel like mere duty.

3. **Love is as strong as death.** This is not poetic exaggeration but theological truth. Love creates bonds that rival mortality in their unbreakable nature.

4. **Love requires wholeness.** Half-hearted devotion isn't the scriptural model. "All thy heart" sets the standard.

5. **Love involves self-giving.** The Christlike pattern is sacrificial love that gives itself for the beloved.

6. **Love brings comfort and healing.** Isaac found comfort in Rebekah's love. Romantic partnership heals wounds that other relationships cannot reach.

## A Valentine's Meditation

As Valentine's Day arrives with its hearts and flowers, these ancient texts invite deeper reflection. The scriptures don't dismiss romantic love as worldly distraction or inferior to spiritual concerns. Instead, they celebrate it as something "strong as death," worthy of seven years' labor, capable of healing grief, modeled on Christ's own self-giving, and commanded to be offered with the whole heart.

Perhaps the truest Valentine's message from scripture is simply this: love deeply, love completely, and recognize in romantic devotion a glimpse of something eternal.
