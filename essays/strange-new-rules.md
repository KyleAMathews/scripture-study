# Strange New Rules: Scripture's Case Against Chosen Ones

The scriptures are surprisingly hostile to "Chosen One" thinking.

We might expect otherwise. After all, the Bible is filled with prophets, kings, and heroes who accomplish remarkable things. The Book of Mormon has Nephi building ships, Ammon defending flocks, Mormon compiling records while empires crumble. Surely these are Special People doing Special Things?

But look closer, and you find something unexpected: a systematic dismantling of the very idea that some people deserve special rules while others get idiot rules. The scriptural witness, taken as a whole, argues that God's kingdom runs on protocols, not personalities—strange new rules that apply equally to all flesh.

## No Respecter of Persons

The foundational principle appears everywhere: "God is no respecter of persons" ([Acts 10:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/10.34)). Paul reinforces it: "There is no respect of persons with God" ([Romans 2:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/2.11)).

Nephi extends this beyond mere favoritism to encompass the entire human family: "All are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile... he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female" ([2 Nephi 26:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33)). And lest we think righteous lineage creates an exemption: "The Lord esteemeth all flesh in one; he that is righteous is favored of God" ([1 Nephi 17:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17.35)). Favor flows from following the protocol of righteousness, not from being born into the right family or anointed by the right authority.

This is a direct assault on what we might call Straussian theology—the idea that different rules apply to elites than to ordinary believers. The gospel is not an esoteric teaching with a public version for the masses and a private version for initiates. The same baptismal covenant applies to prophet and plowman alike.

## The Curse of the Arm of Flesh

If God operates by protocols rather than personalities, what happens when we try to run the kingdom on Chosen One logic? The scriptures are blunt: "Cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh" ([2 Nephi 4:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4.34)).

The Lord makes explicit that He deliberately works through the weak to undermine Great Man theories of history: "The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of flesh" ([D&C 1:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.19)).

Note the connection: trusting in the arm of flesh and having man counsel his fellow man are linked problems. Both assume that some humans possess inherent authority that exempts them from ordinary rules. Both treat the masses as idiots requiring guidance from their betters.

The scriptural pattern is precisely the opposite. Moses wishes all the Lord's people were prophets ([Numbers 11:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/11.29)). Joseph Smith declared any man might become a prophet if he gained the testimony of Jesus ([Revelation 19:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/19.10)). The destination is not a world of Special People managing ordinary people, but a world where extraordinary access becomes ordinary protocol.

## Priestcraft: The Chosen One Business Model

The scriptures have a specific term for what happens when religion gets captured by Chosen One logic: priestcraft.

"Priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion" ([2 Nephi 26:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.29)).

This is the Great Man and Great Bureaucrat pattern applied to religion. The priest becomes special, becomes the light, becomes the mediator between God and man—not because the protocols require it, but because the priest captures value by positioning himself as indispensable. The tragedy of Nehor and his followers was not merely false doctrine but the attempt "to enforce it by the sword" ([Alma 1:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/1.12)). When your authority derives from specialness rather than protocol, you must eventually resort to force to maintain it.

The antidote to priestcraft is not better priests but better protocols—systems that make the priest unnecessary, or at least replaceable, or at minimum accountable.

## The Law Written in Hearts

Jeremiah's prophecy of the new covenant describes the ultimate Whitehead advance—the point at which following God becomes so internalized that it requires no conscious attention:

"I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts... They shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them" ([Jeremiah 31:33-34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/31.33-34)).

Consider what this means: a society where knowledge of God is so universal that instruction becomes unnecessary. No more Great Teachers required. No more spiritual aristocracy mediating between heaven and the common people. The protocol has become native. Like washing hands before surgery or following traffic signals, knowing the Lord becomes an operation performed without thinking about it.

This is protocol heaven—not because rules disappear, but because they become so thoroughly internalized that they no longer feel like rules at all.

## Joel's Democratized Spirit

The same vision appears in Joel's famous prophecy, quoted by Peter at Pentecost: "I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions" ([Joel 2:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/joel/2.28)).

Notice what gets democratized: prophecy, dreams, visions—the very gifts that previously marked someone as special. In the old world, prophets were rare, set apart, distinguished. In the new world, prophecy becomes protocol. The Spirit pours out on all flesh, not selectively on the anointed.

This is not a world where everyone becomes a Great Man. It's a world where the category of Great Man becomes obsolete because the gifts that once made someone great become standard equipment.

## D&C 121: The Protocol of Priesthood Power

Perhaps nowhere do the scriptures more directly address how authority should work in God's kingdom than Doctrine and Covenants 121. The revelation begins with a paradox: "Many are called, but few are chosen" ([D&C 121:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.34)).

Why are so few chosen? Not because God plays favorites, but because "their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men" ([D&C 121:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.35)). The aspiration to honors—to specialness, to being recognized as Great—disqualifies one from being chosen. The very desire to be a Chosen One prevents it.

Then comes the great principle: "The rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and... the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness" ([D&C 121:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.36)). Authority is protocol-dependent. It works only when the protocol of righteousness is followed. No exceptions for Great Men.

And what happens when someone tries to exercise authority through personality rather than protocol? "When we undertake to cover our sins, or to gratify our pride, our vain ambition, or to exercise control or dominion or compulsion upon the souls of the children of men, in any degree of unrighteousness, behold, the heavens withdraw themselves" ([D&C 121:37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.37)).

The system is self-correcting. Authority that operates by Chosen One logic loses its connection to heaven. The power doesn't transfer. The keys don't work. Whatever the organizational chart may say, spiritual authority flows only through proper protocols: "No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned" ([D&C 121:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.41)).

Persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, love unfeigned—these are protocols, not personalities. Anyone can follow them. No one is exempt from them.

## The Body of Christ

Paul's metaphor of the body of Christ in 1 Corinthians 12 is the ecclesiological equivalent of rejecting Chosen One thinking:

"The body is not one member, but many" ([1 Corinthians 12:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12.14)).

"There should be no schism in the body; but... the members should have the same care one for another" ([1 Corinthians 12:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12.25)).

There is no head that is special and a body that is ordinary. There are no members that deserve special rules. The foot cannot say it doesn't belong because it's not a hand. The ear cannot say it doesn't belong because it's not an eye. Every part is necessary, and no part is dispensable.

This is the Star Trek vision applied to the church. Authority goes with whoever is sitting in the chair, performing the function. The eye is special when the body needs to see. The ear is special when the body needs to hear. Specialness is functional, not inherent.

## Zion: The Protocolized Society

The scriptural ideal society is Enoch's Zion: "The Lord called his people Zion, because they were of one heart and one mind, and dwelt in righteousness; and there was no poor among them" ([Moses 7:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.18)).

Four characteristics: one heart, one mind, dwelling in righteousness, no poor among them.

Notice what's missing: no Great Men. No special caste of rulers. No visionary founders whose unique genius makes them indispensable. Instead, there's unity (one heart, one mind), protocol (dwelling in righteousness), and outcome (no poor).

This is the ultimate Whitehead advance—a society so thoroughly aligned on principles of righteousness that inequality becomes impossible. Not because inequality is forbidden by rule, but because the underlying protocols make it unthinkable.

## Living by Strange New Rules

We live in an era that desperately wants Chosen Ones. We oscillate between Great Men who promise to restore past glory and Great Bureaucrats who promise to regulate our way to safety. Both treat ordinary people as idiots requiring management.

The scriptures offer a different path: strange new rules that apply equally to all. A God who is no respecter of persons. Spiritual gifts poured out on all flesh. Authority that operates only through persuasion and love. A Zion where there is no poor among them.

This is not a world waiting to be saved by heroes. It's a world waiting to be transformed by protocols—internalized principles of righteousness that make Great Men unnecessary and Great Bureaucrats obsolete.

The question is not which Chosen One to follow. The question is: What strange new rules are we willing to learn? What protocols of the kingdom are we ready to internalize until they become operations we perform without thinking about them?

The scriptures have been telling us the answer all along. The work is not to find the right Special Person. The work is to become a people where specialness itself becomes ordinary—where the least and the greatest alike know the Lord, where sons and daughters all prophesy, where there is no poor among them.

It is time to protocolize.
