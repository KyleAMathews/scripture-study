# The Divine Repertoire: On Mormon's Paired Narratives and the Character of God

## The Problem

Grant Hardy's analysis of "providential recurrence" in *Understanding the Book of Mormon* identifies one of the most ambitious editorial achievements in all of scripture. Across roughly 200 pages of text — from Mosiah 22 through Alma 62 — Mormon constructs three paired narratives that consistently contrast two modes of faithful action:

- **Competence**: faithful people using planning, skill, and effort to accomplish God's purposes
- **Blessedness**: faithful people trusting beyond their abilities and receiving miraculous divine intervention

Both modes are honored. Neither is criticized. But the narratives are clearly *shaped*: the miraculous tale comes second in every pair, receives more dramatic weight, and links forward to the next narrative cycle. The editorial control is extraordinary — shared vocabulary, matched block lengths, strategic dampening and inflation. Hardy shows the seams.

This raises the question the essay pursues: **is the competence/blessedness pattern a feature of how God operates, or a feature of how Mormon thinks?**

---

## Hardy's Three Pairs

**Pair 1: Limhi's escape vs. Alma₁'s deliverance** (Mosiah 22 and 23–24). Limhi's people escape Lamanite bondage through Gideon's clever plan — extra wine for the guards, slip out at night. God is never mentioned in Mosiah 22. Alma₁'s people, facing the same captors, appeal to God. He lightens their burdens, then sends "a deep sleep" on the Lamanites. They walk out untouched. Mormon tells these stories consecutively, links them with the rare phrase "none could deliver them but the Lord," and then has Alma₁ preach to Limhi's people that God was present in their "competent" escape too — softening the very binary he just constructed.

**Pair 2: Alma₂'s preaching tour vs. the Sons of Mosiah's mission** (Alma 4–16 and 17–27). Alma₂ resigns as chief judge to preach a Nephite Reformation — skilled orator, institutional authority, professional pulpit. Results are substantial but mixed: a church established in several cities, but Ammonihah is a catastrophe. The Sons of Mosiah renounce royal status, go to a "wild and hardened and ferocious people," face hostility and language barriers, and "fasted and prayed much" ([Alma 17:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.3)). Results are extraordinary: kings converted, thousands join the church, converts never fall away. Mormon gives both campaigns roughly equal space despite covering vastly different time periods, and devotes much of Alma's section to the Ammonihah disaster — dampening the competent preacher's success while the blessed missionaries' narrative builds toward escalating miracles.

**Pair 3: Captain Moroni vs. Helaman₂'s stripling warriors** (Alma 52–62). Moroni is professional military — armor, fortifications, strategic maneuvering. Mormon gives him an extraordinary tribute: "if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever" ([Alma 48:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/48.17)). Yet Hardy notes the tensions: Moroni never prays personally, has a fierce temper, writes intemperate letters, and loses cities despite his preparations. Helaman₂ — a high priest, not a soldier — leads 2,000 young men whose parents had covenanted never to fight. They fight with "miraculous strength." In their first battle, not one falls. In the second, 200 faint from blood loss but none die, while 1,000 regular troops are killed. The faith of their mothers is the credited source.

The connecting thread: the second tale in each pair links to the next cycle. Alma₁'s church becomes the organization Alma₂ tries to reform. The Sons of Mosiah's converts are the parents of the stripling warriors. The pattern builds across the full sweep of Mormon's narrative.

## The Editorial Evidence

Hardy's achievement is showing *how* this works — not just that Mormon tells paired stories, but the specific editorial techniques that construct the parallelism. The evidence of craft is real and should not be minimized:

- **Shared vocabulary**: the phrase "gathered their flocks... departed into the wilderness... arrived in the land of Zarahemla... Mosiah received them with joy" appears in nearly identical form across both deliverances, creating a sense of deliberate mirroring
- **Matched block lengths**: despite covering vastly different time periods, the paired narratives receive roughly equal narrative space
- **Strategic dampening**: Alma₂'s preaching success is overshadowed by foregrounding the Ammonihah disaster; Moroni's military skill is undercut by showing tensions and failures
- **Strategic inflation**: Moroni receives a tribute — the "if all men had been like unto Moroni" passage — that Hardy argues strains the evidence
- **Selective compression**: a generation-long conflict that doesn't serve the pattern gets six verses; Helaman₂'s campaign gets extended treatment precisely because it illustrates the contrast

These are not incidental features. They represent, as Hardy puts it, "a remarkable level of editorial control or even literary achievement, though Mormon would undoubtedly disavow his own creativity, claiming instead merely to be making manifest the moral principles of history."

---

## The First Question: Real or Constructed?

This is where the tension seems sharpest. If the pattern is editorially constructed, is it theologically reliable? If it reflects genuine divine action, why do the editorial seams show so clearly?

### The case for ontological reality

Mormon is constrained by sources — he selects from a vast archive but cannot freely invent events. The "thus we see" formula claims to *extract* principles from history, not impose them. The pattern appears not only in Mormon's editorial zone (Mosiah through 4 Nephi) but in Nephi's first-person narrative, which Mormon included without redaction. Nephi's three attempts to obtain the brass plates follow the same structure: chance fails, economic competence fails, "led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do" ([1 Nephi 4:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4.6)) succeeds. Mormon didn't write that — Nephi lived it and narrated it himself.

The pattern also extends far beyond the Book of Mormon. Paul — who never read Mormon — builds an entire theology around it: "my strength is made perfect in weakness" ([2 Corinthians 12:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12.9)). "God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty" ([1 Corinthians 1:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1.27)). The Gideon account states the theology explicitly as divine policy: "The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me" ([Judges 7:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/7.2)). God deliberately reduces the army from 32,000 to 300 — not because 300 is militarily sufficient, but because 32,000 would obscure the source of deliverance.

### The case for editorial construction

Hayden White's point is difficult to evade: "no events are intrinsically tragic" — narrative structure is always imposed by the historian. A millennium of records provides enough raw material to construct *any* pattern through selection and arrangement. Mormon controls what gets included (a tiny fraction of his archive), how it's arranged (consecutively, with matched lengths), and how it's phrased (shared vocabulary creating the sense of parallel). He gives a generation-long conflict six verses when it doesn't illustrate the pattern; he devotes fourteen chapters to Moroni's career because it does. The symmetry is suspiciously clean for messy history.

The Deuteronomistic historians did something structurally identical — imposing a recurring cycle (faithfulness → blessing → apostasy → punishment → repentance → deliverance) on the judges-era tribal hero stories. Noth's insight that the formulaic "the people of Israel did what was evil" (appearing at Judges 3:7, 3:12, 4:1, 10:6, 13:1) is editorial framework, not historical description, applies in principle to Mormon's editorial techniques as well.

### The dissolution

This binary — real vs. constructed — rests on a shared assumption that turns out to be wrong: **that construction and discovery are opposites.** Both positions assume that showing editorial craft challenges ontological reality, or that affirming reality requires minimizing craft.

But consider D&C 9:8, the Restoration's own epistemology of revelation: "you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right" ([D&C 9:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9.8)). Intellectual labor and divine confirmation as a single integrated process. If this is how revelation works, then Mormon's editorial craft — studying out the historical record in his mind, organizing what he sees there, receiving confirmation of his prophetic perception — is not the *alternative* to revelation. It is revelation's mechanism.

Michael Polanyi's concept of *personal knowledge* provides the epistemological framework. Scientific discovery always involves a "personal coefficient" — the scientist's trained intuition guiding what they notice and how they organize it. The knowledge produced is not "merely subjective" because of this personal coefficient; it is genuine knowledge that is only accessible *through* trained subjectivity. The chess grandmaster "sees" winning positions; the experienced radiologist "sees" tumors. These perceptions are simultaneously constructed (by training) and disclosive (of genuine features of reality). The construction and the discovery are the same act.

Mormon's editorial craft is prophetic personal knowledge: trained theological perception that simultaneously shapes what he sees in a thousand years of history and reveals what is genuinely there. Hardy's editorial seams are not embarrassments to be explained away — they are evidence of prophetic perception at work, the visible traces of a trained mind engaging historical material and surfacing what it finds. The craft IS the seeing.

This means Hardy's analysis *enhances* rather than threatens devotional reading. Seeing the editorial seams shows you how prophetic perception works. When Hardy shows the matched block lengths and shared vocabulary, he is showing you Mormon's trained eye organizing what it saw. The art and the revelation are the same thing.

## The Second Question: Is the Binary Sufficient?

Having established that the pattern is both editorially crafted and genuinely disclosive, a harder question emerges: **is competence vs. blessedness the right frame?**

When you walk the standard works looking for how God engages human agency, the landscape turns out to be far richer than two poles. The binary works for Limhi and Alma₁. It works for Gideon and David. But most of scripture lives somewhere else.

### Competence AS miracle

Bezalel and the tabernacle artisans: "I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship" ([Exodus 31:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/31.3)). The Spirit of God manifests here as goldsmithing, stonecutting, artistic design. Is Bezalel "competent" or "blessed"? He is both simultaneously, and the text sees no tension whatsoever. God's intervention *is* the skill.

Daniel in Babylon: "God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom... he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers" ([Daniel 1:17, 20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/1.17)). Daniel's divine gift is not a miracle that bypasses learning — it is learning itself, supernaturally enhanced.

### Blessedness that fails

Abinadi burns. The believers at Ammonihah — women and children who accepted Alma's preaching — are "cast into the fire" ([Alma 14:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14.8)). The same God who sent supernatural drowsiness on Lamanite guards for Alma₁'s people watches these believers die. Alma is constrained by the Spirit not to intervene: "the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory" ([Alma 14:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14.11)). The "blessedness" here is martyrdom, not miracle.

The author of Hebrews catalogs faith-driven miracles for thirty-four verses, then pivots: "others were tortured, not accepting deliverance... they were stoned, they were sawn asunder" ([Hebrews 11:35, 37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11.35)). And the conclusion: "these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise" ([Hebrews 11:39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11.39)). The author of Hebrews knows the pattern — and deliberately breaks it.

Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail receives no miraculous deliverance. God's response: "all these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good" ([D&C 122:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122.7)). Suffering itself is framed as the divine gift.

### The integration model

Joseph in Egypt rises through Potiphar's house, prison, and Pharaoh's court through a seamless blend of administrative competence and divine favor. Pharaoh perceives both simultaneously: "a man in whom the Spirit of God is... there is none so discreet and wise as thou art" ([Genesis 41:38–39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/41.38)). "Spirit of God" and "discreet and wise" are not opposing categories. Joseph is the anti-Gideon: God never strips away his competence to make the divine role visible.

Nehemiah's workers build with "one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon" ([Nehemiah 4:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/4.17)). Prayer AND armed guards. Faith AND professional effort. No interest in separating which part was God and which was Nehemiah.

### Competence without contrast

The wisdom tradition celebrates human diligence as divinely approved — with no blessedness foil required. "The hand of the diligent shall bear rule" ([Proverbs 12:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/12.24)). Jesus praises the servant who invested and multiplied his talents: "Well done, thou good and faithful servant" ([Matthew 25:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25.21)). The wicked servant's failure is not insufficient faith — it is insufficient effort.

D&C 58 makes this explicit: "It is not meet that I should command in all things; for he that is compelled in all things, the same is a slothful and not a wise servant... for the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves" ([D&C 58:26, 28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58.26)). God does not want people waiting for divine commands. The power is *in them*. Agency and initiative are the godly mode.

### Presence without intervention

After the fire on Carmel, Elijah flees Jezebel. God appears not in wind, earthquake, or fire, but in "a still small voice" ([1 Kings 19:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19.12)). The text deliberately deconstructs the spectacular-miracle model. God was *not* in the earthquake. The same God who sent fire on Carmel now communicates through quiet intimacy. This is not competence. This is not blessedness. This is presence — God offering himself rather than results.

---

## The Divine Repertoire

The binary breaks. What replaces it is not chaos but a richer taxonomy — at least eight distinct modes of divine engagement with human agency, each with its own internal logic, its own scriptural home, and its own theological implications:

| Mode | Logic | Key Texts | What It Reveals |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Replace** | God acts alone; humans stand still | Red Sea, Jericho, Alma₁'s deliverance | Sovereignty — God can act unilaterally |
| **Strip** | God reduces resources to make divine action visible | Gideon, David, Ether 12:27 | Pedagogy — God teaches dependence by design |
| **Enhance** | The Spirit manifests as supernaturally heightened skill | Bezalel, Daniel, Pentecost | Dignity — human craft can be Spirit-filled |
| **Instruct** | God provides the blueprint; humans execute | Nephi's ship, brother of Jared, Noah's ark | Collaboration — God and humans co-create |
| **Integrate** | Competence and divine favor seamlessly entangled | Joseph in Egypt, Nehemiah, Alma 17:2-3 | Immanence — God works invisibly within the ordinary |
| **Defer** | God builds capacity and tells humans to act | D&C 58, Proverbs, Parable of Talents | Trust — God believes in human agency |
| **Withdraw** | Faithful dependence does not produce deliverance | Abinadi, Job, Liberty Jail, Hebrews 11 | Mystery — God's purposes transcend outcomes |
| **Presence** | God shows up as being-with, not acting-upon | Still small voice, burning bush, sacrament | Intimacy — God offers Himself, not just results |

Hardy's competence/blessedness binary isolates the **Replace/Strip** cluster and contrasts it with **Integrate/Defer**. This is one valid cross-section of the repertoire — and a brilliant one. But it is a cross-section, not the whole.

---

## Why Mormon Foregrounds What He Does

The eight-mode taxonomy explains Mormon's editorial emphasis without dismissing it. The Strip/Replace cluster is the mode specifically concerned with **making divine authorship legible**. God reduces the army from 32,000 to 300 "lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me." The stated purpose is epistemic: ensuring the audience cannot attribute the outcome to human competence.

Mormon — a prophetic editor tasked with constructing a record that would demonstrate "the hand of God manifest" — would naturally foreground this mode. Not because it is the only mode, but because it is the mode most aligned with his editorial mission. A prophet whose job is to make God visible in history will emphasize the instances where God makes Himself visible. This is genuine prophetic perception: Mormon's trained eye saw a real feature of God's character and presented it with extraordinary editorial clarity. His perception was true and partial — true because the Strip mode is genuinely real, partial because the full repertoire extends well beyond what any single editorial frame can contain.

This is why the standard works require multiple prophets. As Paul put it: "now I see through a glass, darkly" ([1 Corinthians 13:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.12)). Mormon sees the Strip/Replace mode with brilliant clarity. The Proverbs sage sees the Defer mode. Job's poet sees the Withdraw mode. Luke sees Integration at work in Acts. Each prophet perceives one or two modes with particular clarity — and the canon as a whole, the collection of partial prophetic perceptions, becomes the locus where the full repertoire becomes visible.

---

## Hardy's Actual Point

Returning to Hardy's conclusion: his deepest insight is not that blessedness trumps competence. It is that **"God will respond in predictable ways BOTH to those who serve him competently AND ALSO to those who seek blessings beyond their capacities."** The lesson is divine reliability — the same God acting faithfully across different human postures. Hardy calls this "providential recurrence": the recurring evidence that God's character is constant even when the mode of engagement varies.

This maps to the repertoire better than to the binary. The reliability Hardy identifies is not the reliability of a single formula (given input X, expect output Y) but the reliability of a *person* — recognizable across situations without being reducible to any algorithm. Like recognizing a friend's character across a hundred different letters: you know them not because they always say the same thing, but because their way of engaging different situations is distinctively, recognizably *them*.

A God with a rich repertoire of responses is neither domesticated nor epistemically inaccessible. Francesca Murphy's challenge — that a patterned God is a literary character, not a free Person — applies to a God reduced to two modes. It does not apply to a God whose character is expressed through an irreducible plurality that includes a mode (Withdraw) where God refuses to be legible at all. The repertoire contains its own escape hatch against theological domestication.

---

## The Six Stories Revisited

Mapping Hardy's six stories onto the repertoire reveals something important: **none of them maps cleanly to a single mode.** The binary flattens what the texts actually portray.

**Limhi's escape** appears to be pure Defer — God never mentioned, Gideon's cleverness credited. But Alma₁ later preaches to Limhi's people that "it was the Lord that did deliver them" — suggesting Integrate, with God invisibly present in what looked like pure human planning.

**Alma₁'s deliverance** appears to be pure Replace — God causes deep sleep, they walk out. But God first *lightens their burdens*, a partial sustaining intervention before the full miraculous escape. The sequence is Presence → Replace, not just Replace.

**Alma₂'s preaching** appears to be Integrate/Defer — institutional authority, professional skill. But Alma₂ is the current high priest. His institutional position IS a spiritual calling. His sermon content comes from revelation. At Ammonihah, divine intervention eventually comes. The "competent" preacher relies on revelation throughout.

**The Sons of Mosiah** appear to be Strip — renouncing royal status, becoming servants. But "they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently" ([Alma 17:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17.2)). Diligent scripture study. Sound understanding. The text describes rigorous spiritual preparation yielding spiritual power. This is Enhance as much as Strip.

**Moroni** appears to be Defer — professional military competence. But Mormon's extraordinary tribute doesn't quite fit the evidence, suggesting Mormon *wants* competence honored even as he privileges blessedness narratively. The text presents a more complex picture than the binary admits.

**The stripling warriors** appear to be Replace — untrained youth, miraculous strength. But they DO fight. Real combat, real courage, real blood loss. Miraculous *amplification* of human effort, not miraculous *replacement* of it. This is Enhance, not Replace.

Mormon himself softens the binary he constructs. He has Alma₁ retroactively credit God with Limhi's "competent" escape. He notes the Sons of Mosiah's diligent preparation. He gives Moroni an extraordinary tribute. Even the editor who built the binary acknowledges its inadequacy.

---

## The Unresolved Hard Problem

One mode in the repertoire threatens to consume the framework: **Withdraw**.

Abinadi burns. The believers at Ammonihah die. Joseph Smith pleads from Liberty Jail, "O God, where art thou?" ([D&C 121:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.1)). Job's friends offer theological patterns; God's answer from the whirlwind offers no pattern at all — only overwhelming presence and the assertion of mystery: "Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?" ([Job 38:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/38.4)).

The Withdraw mode is the place where God refuses intelligibility. It is the mode where every framework — including this one — meets its limit. Putting it in a taxonomy risks domesticating the very thing it represents: God's freedom to act in ways that resist all categories.

This is perhaps the deepest lesson. The repertoire is not a complete map. It is a way of reading that honors the diversity of what the standard works actually portray — while acknowledging that the God who acts through these modes is always more than the modes can contain. "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts" ([Isaiah 55:8–9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/55.8)).

---

## Conclusion: What This Changes

If the argument holds, it transforms how you read Mormon's paired narratives — and all of scripture.

**You stop asking "is the pattern real or constructed?"** Both questions assume a separation between events and text that sacred history does not exhibit. Mormon's editorial craft is how genuine theological truth becomes visible. The craft IS the seeing.

**You stop treating the competence/blessedness binary as the whole picture.** It is one brilliant cross-section of a richer repertoire. Mormon foregrounds it because it serves his editorial mission of making "the hand of God manifest." Other prophets foreground other modes for other reasons.

**You read the standard works as a collection of partial prophetic perceptions.** Mormon sees Strip and Replace with extraordinary clarity. The Proverbs sage sees Defer. Job's poet sees Withdraw. Daniel's narrator sees Enhance. Joseph's biographer sees Integrate. Elijah's narrator sees Presence. No single prophet captures the full repertoire. The canon does — which is why the canon exists.

**You replace formula with character.** The competence/blessedness binary, stretched across all of scripture, tends toward formula: given human dependence, expect divine intervention. The repertoire resists formula. A God who sometimes replaces, sometimes strips, sometimes enhances, sometimes instructs, sometimes integrates, sometimes defers, sometimes withdraws, sometimes simply shows up — this is a person, not a function. You recognize the character across situations the way you recognize a friend: not because they always do the same thing, but because their way of being across different situations is distinctively, irreducibly *theirs*.

Hardy was right that Mormon is a remarkable editor. Hardy was right that the paired narratives reveal something genuine about how God works. The deeper insight is that what they reveal is one mode of an irreducible repertoire — and God's character is the repertoire, not any single mode within it.
