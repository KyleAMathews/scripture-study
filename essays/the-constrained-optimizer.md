# The Constrained Optimizer: Gospel Entropy, Agency, and the Architecture of Restoration

## I. The Direction of the Arrow

Conventional Protestant thought about Christian apostasy began with a simple vector: truth was established by Christ, corruptions crept in over time, and the Reformation was an attempt to scrape away the accumulated error and recover something closer to the original. The question was always how far the corruption extended and how radical the remedy needed to be. The nonseparating Puritans tried to thread a careful needle, arguing that "the corruption of a thing doth not nullify a thing"---that the church could be damaged without being destroyed. But the deeper they dug, the more destabilizing the archaeology became. How far back did the corruption reach? And what might the ancients have known that we've lost?

This question gave rise to what scholars call *prisca theologia*---ancient theology---the idea that fragments of gospel truth were scattered among pre-Christian peoples. Augustine articulated a version of it in his *Retractions*: "What is now called Christian religion has existed among the ancients, and was not absent from the beginning of the human race." Jonathan Edwards similarly believed God had imparted essential truths to ancient peoples, truths subsequently lost. But for all these thinkers, the vector pointed in one direction: from partial toward complete, from shadow toward substance. Pre-Christian truth was typological---foreshadowing pointing forward to a fulfillment that arrived with Christ and canonical scripture. "We have the gospel as well as they had," a commentator contemporary with Edwards wrote, "and in greater purity."

Joseph Smith inverted the arrow.

"From what we can draw from the Scriptures relative to the teaching of heaven," he said, "we are induced to think that much instruction has been given to man since the beginning which we have not." As his associate Parley Pratt put it with characteristic directness: "We have only the old thing. It was old in Adam's day, it was old in Mormon's day and hid up in the earth, and it was old in 1830 when we first began to preach it."

This is not fulfillment theology. It is recovery theology. The gospel wasn't growing toward completeness; it was complete at the origin and has been degrading ever since. Each dispensation is not an advance but a reconstitution---an attempt to recover what entropy has dispersed. The Book of Mormon operationalizes this claim by depicting a community with explicit, propositional Christian knowledge six hundred years before Christ. Nephi and his people didn't have typological foreshadowings or vague intimations. They had the thing itself:

"We talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our prophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins" ([2 Nephi 25:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.26)).

Jacob went further: "None of the prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken concerning this Christ" ([Jacob 7:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7.11)). And these weren't merely intellectual propositions about a future Messiah. They lived the ordinances. They baptized. They laid hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost. They administered the sacrament in his name. They kept the law of Moses but understood it as pointing to Christ---"for this end was the law given" ([2 Nephi 25:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.25))---rather than being the end in itself.

Smith's scriptural productions pushed this principle relentlessly backward and outward. The Book of Moses records that Adam himself was baptized, received the Holy Ghost, and was taught the gospel in its fullness:

"Thus the Gospel began to be preached, from the beginning, being declared by holy angels sent forth from the presence of God, and by his own voice, and by the gift of the Holy Ghost" ([Moses 5:58](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.58)).

The subsequent verse hammers the point: "And thus all things were confirmed unto Adam, by an holy ordinance, and the Gospel preached, and a decree sent forth, that it should be in the world, until the end thereof" ([Moses 5:59](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5.59)). The gospel was not evolving. It was *present*---fully formed---and was meant to remain in the world permanently. That it didn't remain is not a feature of God's plan but a consequence of human agency operating against divine intent.

Noah received the same commission: "The Lord ordained Noah after his own order, and commanded him that he should go forth and declare his Gospel unto the children of men, even as it was given unto Enoch" ([Moses 8:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8.19)). The phrase "even as it was given unto Enoch" is crucial. Not a modified version. Not a simplified version for a less sophisticated audience. The same gospel, transmitted intact from one dispensation to the next---or at least, intended to be.

And Smith pushed the origin point beyond even Adam. Abraham was shown "the intelligences that were organized before the world was" and the grand council where the plan was established ([Abraham 3:22-25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.22-25)). The gospel predates creation itself. It exists in a fundamentally different ontological register from anything merely historical. Every earthly dispensation, including the Christian one, is a partial projection of something that was complete before the world was formed.

## II. Gospel Entropy

If truth was complete at the origin and degrades over time, then religious history is a thermodynamic process. Truth is a conserved quantity that disperses, requiring energy input---angelic visitation, prophetic calling, divine intervention---to reconcentrate. This is the opposite of the progressive revelation model that dominates most Christian theology, where truth *grows* as God gradually unfolds his plan to an increasingly mature humanity.

Smith's model treats truth like a signal in a noisy channel. Each generation receives the transmission but introduces distortion---through misunderstanding, cultural contamination, deliberate corruption, simple forgetfulness. The distortion compounds. After enough generations, the signal degrades below the noise floor. The prophets warned of exactly this:

"The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant" ([Isaiah 24:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/24.5)).

"They have taken away from the gospel of the Lamb many parts which are plain and most precious; and also many covenants of the Lord have they taken away" ([1 Nephi 13:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.26)).

The taking away is active. It's not natural drift; it's editing, redaction, removal. And the consequence is precisely what information theory would predict---catastrophic signal loss that cascades:

"Because of these things which are taken away out of the gospel of the Lamb, an exceedingly great many do stumble" ([1 Nephi 13:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.29)).

Amos described the end state: "I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord: and they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it" ([Amos 8:11-12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/8.11-12)). The signal has degraded below the noise floor. People search for it and cannot find it---not because God has withdrawn it capriciously, but because the channel has been corrupted beyond recovery through ordinary means.

Paul saw the same pattern beginning in his own lifetime: "The time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables" ([2 Timothy 4:3-4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-tim/4.3-4)). The receivers themselves select for noise over signal, preferring distorted messages that conform to their preferences over accurate transmissions that challenge them.

This is the entropic process: not a single catastrophic event but a gradual, systematic degradation driven by the very agency that makes the system meaningful. People choose to corrupt the channel. They edit the scriptures. They adapt the ordinances. They heap to themselves teachers who tell them what they want to hear. And the cumulative effect is apostasy---not as rebellion but as information loss so severe that the original signal becomes unrecoverable from within the system.

## III. The Constrained Optimizer

Here is where the model becomes genuinely interesting. If truth degrades through human agency, the obvious question is: why doesn't God simply prevent the degradation? He's God. Why not protect the channel? Why not make the signal immune to corruption?

The answer is buried in the metaphysics. Human intelligences are co-eternal with God---uncreated, autonomous, possessed of agency that is not granted by God but is constitutive of their very nature:

"Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be" ([D&C 93:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.29)).

"All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence" ([D&C 93:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.30)).

That last clause is the key: "otherwise there is no existence." Agency isn't a feature God added to intelligences. It's what they *are*. To override agency would be to destroy the thing itself. And this is precisely what Satan proposed in the premortal council: "to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him" ([Moses 4:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/4.3)). The offer was to guarantee outcomes by eliminating choice. The entire plan of salvation was constructed as the alternative to that offer.

God, then, is operating as a constrained optimizer. The objective function is "to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man" ([Moses 1:39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.39)). The hard constraint is the preservation of agency. And this constraint is absolute---it cannot be relaxed without collapsing the entire system. A being whose agency has been overridden cannot achieve "eternal life" in any meaningful sense, because the achievement requires autonomous choice under conditions of genuine uncertainty.

This reframes everything about how God operates in history. Revelation is not generous overflow from an omnipotent being. It is the *minimum necessary intervention* to keep the system from irreversible divergence. Each dispensation is a corrective impulse applied when the entropic drift has passed some threshold of recoverable error. Too much intervention destroys the autonomy that makes the outcome meaningful. Too little, and the signal degrades beyond recovery. The dispensational pattern Smith describes---Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Christ, Smith himself---is what you'd expect from an optimizer operating under this constraint: intermittent, calibrated corrections applied when the system drifts too far.

And the corrections are genuinely minimal. God gave Adam the full gospel, then apparently watched it degrade across centuries until Enoch's day. He reconstituted it through Enoch, then watched it degrade again until Noah. The pattern repeats: injection, entropy, injection, entropy. God doesn't hover. He doesn't continuously correct. He allows the system to run, with all the drift and error that free agents introduce, and intervenes only when recovery requires external input.

Lehi articulated the underlying logic with remarkable precision:

"It must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so... all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility" ([2 Nephi 2:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11)).

Without opposition---without the genuine possibility of error, corruption, and loss---the system is static. Dead. The very entropy that degrades the gospel signal is the same dynamic that makes moral choice, growth, and ultimately exaltation possible. You cannot have one without the other. The constrained optimizer doesn't eliminate entropy; he manages it.

## IV. Bandwidth and the Veil

The constraint operates at every scale, including the individual. Consider the veil of forgetfulness---the mechanism by which premortal knowledge is hidden from mortal consciousness. If you remembered the grand council, remembered God, remembered choosing to come---the test would be fundamentally different. Full information would collapse the decision space into determinism. You need uncertainty for choice to be meaningful.

"Faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true" ([Alma 32:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.21)). The veil creates what a game designer would call a "fog of war"---you have to act under uncertainty, and it's the uncertainty that makes your choices revelatory of who you actually are. Paul described the condition: "Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known" ([1 Corinthians 13:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13.12)).

The information asymmetry between God and humanity isn't an accident or a punishment. It's a design requirement. Fallen epistemic conditions are the medium in which agency operates.

But the constraint doesn't stop at the veil. It extends to revelation itself. God's information delivery is explicitly rate-limited, calibrated to what the receivers can metabolize:

"I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom; for unto him that receiveth I will give more; and from them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have" ([2 Nephi 28:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30)).

This is not arbitrary rationing. It's the optimal information delivery schedule for bounded rational agents operating under uncertainty. You give them what they can metabolize without collapsing their agency. Too much signal would overwhelm the receiver. Too little and they can't navigate at all. "Line upon line, precept upon precept" is adaptive bandwidth management.

And the system is explicitly demand-driven. The receiver determines the channel capacity:

"It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him" ([Alma 12:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.9)).

The heed and diligence of the audience determines how much can be transmitted. This isn't elitism or withholding for its own sake. It's the same agency constraint operating at the collective level. A community that isn't ready for a particular truth would either reject it (wasting the signal) or be overwhelmed by it (destroying agency). The constrained optimizer transmits at the maximum rate the receivers can handle, and not a word more.

## V. The Prophet as Bottleneck

This model becomes recursive---and almost vertiginous---when you realize that Smith wasn't just describing the constrained optimizer. He was instantiating it. He was a node in his own model, facing the identical problem at a smaller scale: he had signal he believed he'd received, and he was rate-limited not by God's willingness to transmit but by his audience's capacity to absorb.

The scriptural record itself documents this bottleneck with startling self-awareness. Mormon, compiling his record, wrote:

"I was about to write them, all which were engraven upon the plates of Nephi, but the Lord forbade it, saying: I will try the faith of my people" ([3 Nephi 26:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26.11)).

The greater things are explicitly withheld. Not because they don't exist. Not because God is reluctant. But because the receivers must first demonstrate readiness by responding to what's already been given:

"If it so be that they will not believe these things, then shall the greater things be withheld from them, unto their condemnation" ([3 Nephi 26:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26.10)).

Moroni documented the same conditional lock on the sealed portion of the gold plates: "In that day that they shall exercise faith in me, saith the Lord, even as the brother of Jared did, that they may become sanctified in me, then will I manifest unto them the things which the brother of Jared saw, even to the unfolding unto them all my revelations" ([Ether 4:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/4.7)). The information exists. The source is willing. The constraint is on the demand side.

But notice: this is not a deadlock. The scriptures are careful to describe a ratchet, not a circular dependency. The condition for receiving more is not that you already have more---it's that you *heed* what you already have. Alma's formulation is precise: the greater portion goes to those who do not "harden their hearts" against the portion they've already received; the lesser portion goes to those who do ([Alma 12:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.10)). The starting information is always sufficient to begin. The bottleneck isn't missing data. It's unheeded data. The system advances not by waiting for an external interrupt but by the receivers finally acting on the signal that's already present---at which point the channel opens wider. It's a feedback loop, not a deadlock: faithful response to the current signal is itself the mechanism that increases bandwidth for the next transmission.

Smith seems to have experienced this bottleneck personally. His massive revelatory output in the Kirtland period---Doctrine and Covenants sections pouring out, the Book of Moses material, temple theology, the Lectures on Faith---was high-bandwidth transmission to a small, relatively cohesive receiver group. Then the system destabilized. Apostasy, financial collapse, internal revolt. By Nauvoo, the pattern had shifted to partial disclosure, private teachings to inner circles, repeated laments that the Saints weren't ready. The famous line captures it: "It is my meditation all the day and more than my meat and drink to know how I shall make the Saints of God to comprehend the visions that roll like an overflowing surge, before my mind." That's the transmission problem stated explicitly. He's experiencing what he interprets as high-bandwidth input from the divine channel, and he's bottlenecked at the output by receiver limitations.

And then he died before transmitting everything he believed he'd received. Which means---if the model is correct---that Smith's own unreceived revelations are themselves subject to the same degradation he described as characterizing every previous dispensation. The very process he was describing claimed him too. Everything after his death is reconstruction from fragments, which is exactly the condition he said characterized every post-apostasy period.

The pattern is fractal. It repeats at every scale.

## VI. The Palace in Ruins

Smith's vision of what the restoration project actually looked like was not the neat, linear process that later institutional narratives would suggest. It was archaeological. As Terryl Givens describes it, Smith saw the world as "replete with scattered fragments" of a once-complete system---like an ancient palace reduced to ruins, its columns, lintels, and carved stones strewn across cultures, traditions, and centuries. The restorer's task was not to receive a pristine, completed blueprint from heaven but to gather the scattered pieces and reassemble them.

This is why Smith insisted that Mormonism had no creed and should never have one. "The most prominent difference in sentiment between the Latter-day Saints and sectarians was, that the latter were all circumscribed by some peculiar creed, which deprived its members the privilege of believing anything not contained therein, whereas the Latter-day Saints have no creed, but are ready to believe all true principles that exist, as they are made manifest from time to time."

The epistemological principle was explicit: truth is the universal set, and any boundary drawn around it is by definition incomplete. "If the Presbyterians have any truth, embrace that. If the Baptists and Methodists have truth, embrace that too. Get all the good in the world if you want to come out a pure Mormon." And: "We don't ask any people to throw away any good they have got; we only ask them to come and get more."

This openness wasn't ecumenical sentimentality. It was instrumentally necessary for the revelatory project itself. If revelation is filtered through the prophet's existing conceptual apparatus, then the richness of that apparatus determines channel capacity. Every truth absorbed from any source---Protestant theology, Masonic symbolism, biblical scholarship, folk tradition---increases the system's capacity to receive and articulate the next revelation. Smith was bootstrapping: using whatever partial truths were available to increase his capacity to receive more complete ones. "Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come" ([D&C 130:18-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.18-19)).

This is why God declares that he speaks to *all nations*, not just the covenant people:

"Know ye not that there are more nations than one? Know ye not that I, the Lord your God, have created all men, and that I remember those who are upon the isles of the sea; and that I rule in the heavens above and in the earth beneath; and I bring forth my word unto the children of men, yea, even upon all the nations of the earth?" ([2 Nephi 29:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.7)).

And again: "The Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should have" ([Alma 29:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/29.8)). Fragments of the palace are distributed globally, embedded in the religious and philosophical traditions of every people. The restoration project isn't about building from scratch. It's about gathering scattered stones.

And the assertion that the Bible itself is one partial record among many---however offensive to Protestant sensibilities---follows directly from the entropy model:

"Because that ye have a Bible ye need not suppose that it contains all my words; neither need ye suppose that I have not caused more to be written" ([2 Nephi 29:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.10)).

"I shall speak unto the Jews and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the other tribes of the house of Israel, which I have led away, and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto all nations of the earth and they shall write it" ([2 Nephi 29:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.12)).

The canon is not closed because the palace has not been fully excavated. The ninth Article of Faith codifies this as a permanent principle: "We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God" ([Articles of Faith 1:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.9)).

## VII. Weak Things and Noisy Channels

One of the most counterintuitive features of the model is that the channel noise is not merely tolerated but *required*.

"The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of flesh" ([D&C 1:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.19)).

"Unto this end have I raised you up, that I might show forth my wisdom through the weak things of the earth" ([D&C 124:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124.1)).

"I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them" ([Ether 12:27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27)).

Paul articulated the same principle: "We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us" ([2 Corinthians 4:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/4.7)).

This is an information-theoretic argument, though none of these writers would have used that vocabulary. If the prophet were a perfect channel---noiseless, undistorted---you couldn't distinguish the signal from the channel itself. A perfect transmission would be indistinguishable from the prophet's own genius. A flawed transmission with content that exceeds the prophet's capacity is evidence of an external source. The imperfections authenticate the signal. God works through "the weak things of the earth" not despite their weakness but because of it---the visible channel noise is what allows the audience to identify the signal as coming from beyond the channel.

Smith seems to have understood this about his own output. "A Prophet is not always a Prophet," he said, "only when he is acting as such." That's not just humility. It's an epistemological claim that prophetic reception is a mode---intermittent, situated, filtered through a flawed human apparatus---and that treating any prophet's every utterance as divine signal is itself a form of error. Nephi confessed the limitation from the other side: "I cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither am I mighty in writing, like unto speaking" ([2 Nephi 33:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.1)). And Moroni begged the reader: "Condemn me not because of mine imperfection... but rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been" ([Mormon 9:31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mormon/9.31)).

The imperfections are pedagogically necessary. They invite the reader into active engagement---parsing signal from noise---rather than passive reception. They preserve the reader's agency by requiring judgment rather than demanding submission to an irresistible source. The constrained optimizer, once again, chooses the strategy that maximizes agency at every level: the prophet's agency to synthesize and speculate, and the audience's agency to evaluate and discern.

## VIII. The Counter-Entropic Project

If every other aspect of the system runs toward entropy---truth degrading, ordinances being corrupted, knowledge being lost---then one feature of the restoration stands in stark contrast. The sealing work runs against entropy.

"It is sufficient to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other between the fathers and the children... for we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect... that a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories should take place, and be revealed from the days of Adam even to the present time" ([D&C 128:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.18)).

"Their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation... that they without us cannot be made perfect---neither can we without our dead be made perfect" ([D&C 128:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128.15)).

The optimization target isn't individual salvation. It's the construction of a complete relational network---"a whole and complete and perfect union"---linking every human being who has ever lived into a connected graph. The sealing of families to families, back through all of history, forward through all of posterity, is the one process in the system that is explicitly cumulative rather than cyclical. Dispensations rise and fall. Truths are revealed and lost. But the sealing work, once done, holds.

Malachi framed this as the ultimate purpose of the prophetic tradition: "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse" ([Malachi 4:5-6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/4.5-6)). The turning of hearts---backward toward ancestors, forward toward posterity---is presented as the difference between a cursed earth and a redeemed one. Not doctrinal purity. Not institutional continuity. Relational connection.

This is why the "dispensation of the fulness of times" is not just another dispensation in the cycle but something categorically different. It's not merely another corrective impulse. It's the beginning of the counter-entropic project: the welding together of *all* dispensations into a single, continuous structure. Every previous dispensation contributed local gains---truth received, ordinances performed, covenants made---but those gains were isolated, vulnerable to the next entropic cycle. The fulness of times is the moment when the system begins integrating those isolated gains into something durable.

And the project is explicitly open-ended. It can't be completed instantaneously. The doctrines could theoretically be fully recovered in a single revelatory moment. But the sealing of every human family that has ever existed is a project that requires time, effort, and the willing participation of living agents acting on behalf of the dead. It's the ultimate expression of the constrained optimizer: the goal is achievable, but only through the free action of the very agents whose agency constrains the process.

## IX. The Material Cosmos

Underlying all of this is a metaphysical commitment that makes Smith's theology genuinely alien to mainstream Christianity and genuinely coherent as a system: the rejection of dualism.

"There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes" ([D&C 131:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131.7)).

"The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's" ([D&C 130:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.22)).

"Spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy; and when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy" ([D&C 93:33-34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.33-34)).

The brother of Jared saw Christ's spirit body and was astonished: "I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood." Christ responded: "This body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh" ([Ether 3:8-9, 16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3.8-9,16)).

In one stroke, Smith dissolved the interaction problem that had plagued Western philosophy since Descartes. If mind and matter are fundamentally different substances, how do they interact? How does an immaterial soul move a physical arm? How does prayer reach an immaterial God? How can a physical ordinance have spiritual efficacy? Centuries of theology had been spent on these questions. Smith's answer: the question is malformed. There is only one kind of substance, existing on a spectrum of refinement. Spirit is fine matter, not a different ontological category. God is embodied, located, material. Ordinances work because everything operates within the same material continuum.

This is why the resurrection isn't theologically awkward in Smith's framework the way it is in classical Christianity. If the goal is to liberate an immaterial soul from a material body, why re-embody it? But if embodiment is a promotion---if the whole point is the *permanent* fusion of spirit and element into something greater than either alone---then resurrection is the telos, not a concession. And the spirit that separates from the body at death isn't a pattern that needs to be reconstructed from a snapshot; it's a persistent material entity that continues, retaining everything it has become through mortal experience.

And this material cosmos is vast:

"Worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten" ([Moses 1:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1.33)).

"By him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God" ([D&C 76:24](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.24)).

If God is embodied and material, and there are worlds without number each populated by his children, then the cosmos is not a stage for a singular drama but the operational infrastructure of an ongoing project. Trade, communication, visitation, collaboration between divine beings across worlds---these aren't speculative flights of fancy. They're what you'd expect from the premises. The 19th-century elders who speculated about gods of different worlds interacting with each other weren't being fanciful. They were reasoning forward from a monist metaphysics that placed God *inside* the cosmos rather than outside it.

Smith's God is not the unmoved mover of Aristotle, not the pure actuality of Aquinas, not the wholly other of Barth. He is an embodied being who was once as we are, who progressed to his current state, who operates within the same material reality his children inhabit. The optimizer is a participant, not an architect. The constraints on his intervention aren't arbitrary divine policy---they're structural features of a reality he shares with the intelligences he's trying to elevate. He couldn't override their agency even if he wanted to, because their agency is co-eternal with his existence.

## X. The Infinite Game

James Carse distinguished between finite and infinite games. Finite games are played to win---to reach a terminal state, to settle the question. Infinite games are played to continue playing---to keep the game going, to prevent any resolution that would end it.

Smith's open-ended restoration is structurally an infinite game. New truth is always arriving. The system is never complete. "We believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God." The ninth Article of Faith is a commitment to permanent incompleteness---a declaration that no snapshot of the tradition at any point in time can be treated as definitive.

But institutions are finite game players by nature. They need stable doctrine to maintain authority, boundaries to define membership, orthodoxy to ensure coherence. The organizational logic required to transmit the tradition across generations is antithetical to the founding epistemology of openness. You can't run a global organization on "embrace all truth wherever you find it." You need manuals, curricula, hierarchies of interpretive authority. And every one of those structures is a filter that reduces bandwidth---a noise-reduction strategy that is also, inevitably, a signal-rejection strategy.

Smith seems to have half-recognized this. His resistance to creeds, his insistence on ongoing revelation, his comfort with speculation and error---these are attempts to build institutional antibodies against institutional closure. But it's an inherently unstable design. The moment anyone treats the current state of the restoration as complete---the moment someone says "We have enough"---the system begins to collapse:

"From them that shall say, We have enough, from them shall be taken away even that which they have" ([2 Nephi 28:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30)).

"A Bible! A Bible! We have got a Bible, and there cannot be any more Bible" ([2 Nephi 29:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.3)). The verse was written about Protestants who rejected the Book of Mormon, but its logic applies to anyone who treats any existing collection of texts as the final word---including Latter-day Saints who treat their own canon as closed.

The "dispensation of the fulness of times" is not the moment when God finally reveals everything. It's the moment when the accumulated state of the system can support a higher-bandwidth channel---when the counter-entropic sealing work can finally begin in earnest, when the scattered fragments can start to be reassembled, when the welding of dispensations can commence. But the work itself remains open-ended. The palace is always under reconstruction. New rooms are being discovered. The surface area of contact with what remains unknown expands with every new piece of recovered knowledge.

Which means the more you restore, the more you realize is missing. Another entropic dynamic. Another expression of the infinite game.

"Because that I have spoken one word ye need not suppose that I cannot speak another; for my work is not yet finished; neither shall it be until the end of man, neither from that time henceforth and forever" ([2 Nephi 29:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29.9)).

The work is not yet finished. The channel remains open. The signal continues. And the only question---the question that determines everything about what can be received and when---is whether the receivers are ready to hear it.

"Behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free" ([Helaman 14:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.30)).

The constrained optimizer has done everything he can within the constraints. The rest is up to us.
