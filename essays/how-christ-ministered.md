# How Christ Ministered: Patterns from the Scriptures

An analysis of specific episodes from Christ's ministry, examining what he noticed, how he approached people, his methods, and the outcomes.

---

## I. What Christ Noticed

### A. He Saw Individuals in Crowds

Christ had a remarkable ability to perceive the one amid the many:

- **The woman with the issue of blood** - In a pressing crowd, he sensed one specific touch: "Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?" ([Mark 5:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/5.30)). His disciples thought it absurd - "Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?" - but he knew the difference between incidental contact and desperate faith.

- **Zacchaeus in the sycamore tree** - Walking through Jericho with crowds pressing, "Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him" ([Luke 19:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/19.5)). He saw a man others overlooked or despised.

- **The blind man from birth** - "As Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth" ([John 9:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/9.1)). The disciples saw a theological puzzle ("who did sin?"); Christ saw a person.

### B. He Perceived Internal States

Christ read hearts, not just circumstances:

- **The Samaritan woman** - He knew her history: "Thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband" ([John 4:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/4.18)). She responded: "Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet."

- **The rich young ruler** - "Then Jesus beholding him loved him" ([Mark 10:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/10.21)). Before diagnosing the problem, he beheld and loved.

- **The multitudes** - "When he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd" ([Matthew 9:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/9.36)). He saw exhaustion and disorientation beneath the surface.

- **The Nephite multitude** - "He cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry" ([3 Nephi 17:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.5)). He noticed their unspoken longing.

### C. He Noticed Faith

Faith drew his attention repeatedly:

- **The paralytic's friends** - "When Jesus saw their faith" - the faith of those who carried the man and tore through the roof - "he said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee" ([Mark 2:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/2.5)).

- **The Nephites' faith** - "I perceive that your faith is sufficient that I should heal you" ([3 Nephi 17:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.8)).

- **The centurion's faith** - "When Jesus heard it, he marvelled... I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel" ([Matthew 8:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/8.10)).

---

## II. How He Made Contact

### A. He Initiated Conversation

Christ often spoke first, breaking social barriers:

- **The Samaritan woman** - "Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink" ([John 4:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/4.7)). He initiated, crossing ethnic and gender boundaries that shocked even her: "How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?"

- **Zacchaeus** - Christ called him by name unprompted: "Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house" ([Luke 19:5](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/19.5)).

- **Matthew the publican** - Simply: "Follow me. And he arose, and followed him" ([Matthew 9:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/9.9)).

### B. He Touched the Untouchable

Physical contact was deliberate and meaningful:

- **The leper** - "Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and touched him" ([Mark 1:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/1.41)). Lepers were ritually unclean; touching them was forbidden. Christ touched first, then healed.

- **The blind man** - "He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man" ([John 9:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/9.6)). Intimate, physical, personal.

- **The Nephites one by one** - "The multitude went forth... going forth one by one until they had all gone forth, and did see with their eyes and did feel with their hands" ([3 Nephi 11:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.15)). Christ permitted 2,500 people to individually touch his wounds.

### C. He Asked Questions

Rather than prescribing, he often inquired:

- **Blind Bartimaeus** - "What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?" ([Mark 10:51](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/10.51)). The answer was obvious - a blind man wanted sight - but Christ invited him to articulate his desire.

- **The Nephite disciples** - "What is it that ye desire of me, after that I am gone to the Father?" ([3 Nephi 28:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28.1)). He asked them one by one.

- **Peter's restoration** - Three times: "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" ([John 21:15-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/21.15)). Not to extract information, but to heal through repetition what had been broken through repetition.

## III. His Methods of Helping

### A. He Addressed the Deeper Need

Physical healing often accompanied or followed spiritual ministry:

- **The paralytic** - Came for physical healing; Christ addressed sin first: "Son, thy sins be forgiven thee." Only after the Pharisees objected did he add: "Arise, and take up thy bed" ([Mark 2:5-11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/2.5)).

- **The sinful woman** - She came to anoint him; he declared her sins forgiven and noted her love: "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much" ([Luke 7:47](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/7.47)).

- **The woman caught in adultery** - Facing death, she needed physical rescue. Christ provided it, then addressed the spiritual: "Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more" ([John 8:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8.11)).

### B. He Required Participation

Healing was rarely passive:

- **The ten lepers** - "Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed" ([Luke 17:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/17.14)). Healing came during obedience, not before.

- **The blind man at Siloam** - "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam... He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing" ([John 9:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/9.7)).

- **The paralytic** - "Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house" ([Mark 2:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/2.11)). The command to act demonstrated the healing.

- **The rich young ruler** - "Go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor... and come, take up the cross, and follow me" ([Mark 10:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/10.21)).

### C. He Used Different Approaches for Different People

There was no single formula:

- **Nicodemus** - Extended theological dialogue, meeting an intellectual where he was ([John 3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/3)).

- **The Samaritan woman** - Questions leading to revelation, respecting her intelligence and engaging her curiosity.

- **The leper** - Immediate touch and healing with minimal words: "I will; be thou clean" ([Mark 1:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/1.41)).

- **The centurion** - He adapted to the centurion's expressed faith, healing at a distance: "as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee" ([Matthew 8:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/8.13)).

### D. He Acknowledged Their Agency

He did not force outcomes:

- **The Nephites** - "Have ye any that are sick among you? Bring them hither" ([3 Nephi 17:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.7)). An invitation, not a mandate.

- **Blind Bartimaeus** - "What wilt thou that I should do unto thee?" - inviting him to state his desire explicitly.

## IV. The Emotional Dimension

### A. Compassion as Motivation

The Greek word (splagchnizomai) suggests visceral response:

- "Moved with compassion, put forth his hand" - the leper ([Mark 1:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/1.41))
- "Moved with compassion on them, because they fainted" - the multitudes ([Matthew 9:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/9.36))
- "My bowels are filled with compassion towards you" ([3 Nephi 17:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.6))

### B. Weeping

Christ wept at least twice in recorded scripture:

- **At Lazarus's tomb** - "Jesus wept" ([John 11:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/11.35)), and before that: "he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled" ([John 11:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/11.33)).

- **With the Nephite children** - "He wept, and the multitude bare record of it, and he took their little children, one by one, and blessed them, and prayed unto the Father for them" ([3 Nephi 17:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.21)). Then: "when he had done this he wept again."

### C. Joy

Ministry also brought him joy:

- "Now behold, my joy is full" ([3 Nephi 17:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.20)) - said after seeing their faith.

### D. Groaning/Trouble

Christ felt troubled by wickedness and its effects:

- "Jesus groaned within himself, and said: Father, I am troubled because of the wickedness of the people of the house of Israel" ([3 Nephi 17:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.14)).

## V. Successes and Failures

### A. Notable Successes

**Transformative encounters:**
- The Samaritan woman became an evangelist: "Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?" ([John 4:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/4.29))
- Zacchaeus immediately committed to restitution: "The half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold" ([Luke 19:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/19.8))
- Blind Bartimaeus "received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way" ([Mark 10:52](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/10.52))
- The woman caught in adultery - per JST: "the woman glorified God from that hour, and believed on his name" ([John 8:11 JST](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8.11))

**Physical healings** - uniformly successful when attempted. Every healing recorded was complete.

### B. Notable Failures (by earthly metrics)

**The rich young ruler:**
- "He was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great possessions" ([Mark 10:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/10.22))
- Christ diagnosed correctly ("one thing thou lackest"), offered the right prescription, but the man chose otherwise. Christ did not chase him, manipulate him, or soften the requirement.

**The nine lepers:**
- All ten were healed; only one returned: "Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?" ([Luke 17:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/17.17))
- Christ helped them anyway. The question was asked not in bitterness but observation.

**Nazareth:**
- "He could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them. And he marvelled because of their unbelief" ([Mark 6:5-6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/6.5))
- Even Christ's ministry was constrained by recipients' lack of faith.

**Judas:**
- Three years of intimate discipleship; betrayal.

## VI. Commonalities Across Episodes

### A. Dignity Preserved

Christ never shamed those he helped:

- The sinful woman - he defended her against Simon's mental criticism
- The woman caught in adultery - he dispersed her accusers before addressing her
- The woman with the issue of blood - "Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace" ([Mark 5:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/5.34)) - a term of endearment, not exposure

### B. Faith Acknowledged

Almost formulaic: "Thy faith hath made thee whole."
- The woman with the issue of blood ([Mark 5:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/5.34))
- Blind Bartimaeus ([Mark 10:52](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/10.52))
- The sinful woman ([Luke 7:50](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/7.50))
- The one grateful leper ([Luke 17:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/17.19))

Faith was never optional - but Christ worked with the faith available, even "as a grain of mustard seed."

### C. Social Boundaries Crossed

Christ consistently crossed lines others would not:

- **Ethnicity** - Samaritans, Romans, Syrophoenicians
- **Purity** - Lepers, the woman with the issue of blood, the dead
- **Morality** - Publicans, sinners, adulterers
- **Class** - Rich and poor, rulers and beggars

### D. Personal, Not Transactional

Ministry was relational:

- He knew Zacchaeus's name
- He asked Bartimaeus what he wanted
- He spoke to each Nephite disciple "one by one"
- He blessed each child individually: "he took their little children, one by one"

### E. Sending Forth

Ministry often ended with commissioning:

- "Go in peace" (sinful woman, woman with issue of blood)
- "Go thy way" (paralytic, blind Bartimaeus, lepers)
- "Go, and sin no more" (woman caught in adultery)
- "Feed my sheep" (Peter)
- "Come, follow me" (disciples)

Christ healed not to create dependence but to restore capacity for living and serving.

## VII. Summary Observations

**What Christ did:**
1. He saw individuals - their circumstances, their hearts, their faith
2. He initiated contact, often crossing boundaries to do so
3. He touched people, physically and personally
4. He asked questions rather than assuming
5. He addressed root needs, not just presenting symptoms
6. He required participation and agency
7. He adapted his approach to the person
8. He felt deeply - compassion, grief, joy
9. He preserved dignity
10. He sent people forth to live, not to cling

**What he did not do:**
1. He did not manipulate or coerce
2. He did not soften hard truths to retain followers
3. He did not heal without faith being present somewhere
4. He did not create dependency
5. He did not shame publicly or privately
6. He did not keep score on the ungrateful

The pattern suggests ministry is fundamentally about seeing, reaching, and releasing - perceiving true need, making meaningful contact, and enabling people to go forward transformed.
