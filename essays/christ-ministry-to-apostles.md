# Christ's Ministry to His Apostles: A Leadership Development Study

How did Christ develop leaders? Examining his three-year investment in the Twelve and his ministry to the Nephite disciples reveals patterns of calling, training, correction, restoration, and commission.

---

## I. The Calling: How He Selected Them

### A. He Called Ordinary Men

The Twelve were not religious elites:

- **Fishermen** - Peter, Andrew, James, John. "Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men" ([Mark 1:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/1.17)).

- **A tax collector** - Matthew/Levi, despised collaborator with Rome. Christ saw him at the receipt of custom and simply said: "Follow me. And he arose, and followed him" ([Matthew 9:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/9.9)).

- **A zealot** - Simon the Zealot, politically opposite to Matthew. Christ brought together men who would not naturally associate.

### B. He Called Them to Himself First

The initial call was relational, not institutional:

- "Follow me" - not "believe this doctrine" or "join this organization"
- "He ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth" ([Mark 3:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/3.14)). Being with him preceded being sent.

### C. He Saw Potential, Not Just Present State

- **Simon renamed Cephas** - "Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone" ([John 1:42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/1.42)). Simon was impulsive and unstable; Christ named him Rock.

- **Nathanael** - "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!" ([John 1:47](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/1.47)). Christ identified his character before knowing him.

### D. The Nephite Pattern

Christ chose the Nephite Twelve similarly:

- Called them one by one, giving each "power to baptize" ([3 Nephi 11:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.22))
- Told the multitude: "Blessed are ye if ye shall give heed unto the words of these twelve whom I have chosen from among you to minister unto you, and to be your servants" ([3 Nephi 12:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.1))

---

## II. The Training: How He Developed Them

### A. Proximity and Observation

The apostles learned by watching:

- They were present for healings, teachings, confrontations
- "His disciples came unto him" repeatedly for private explanation ([Matthew 13:36](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/13.36), [Matthew 24:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24.3))
- They saw his prayer life, his interactions, his responses to opposition

### B. Graduated Responsibility

Christ gave them missions before they were fully trained:

**First mission (Matthew 10, Mark 6, Luke 9):**
- "He called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases" ([Luke 9:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/9.1))
- Sent "two and two" for mutual support ([Mark 6:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/6.7))
- Gave specific instructions on what to take, where to go, how to respond to rejection

**Debrief after mission:**
- "The apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught" ([Mark 6:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/6.30))
- Then: "Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while" ([Mark 6:31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/6.31))

Christ reviewed their work, then ensured rest. Ministry was supervised, not abandoned.

### C. Progressive Revelation

He taught them in stages:

- "I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now" ([John 16:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/16.12))
- To the Nephites: "I perceive that ye are weak, that ye cannot understand all my words... prepare your minds for the morrow, and I come unto you again" ([3 Nephi 17:2-3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17.2))

He met them where they were, not where he wished they were.

### D. Inner Circle for Deeper Training

Peter, James, and John received additional experiences:

- **Transfiguration** - witnessed his glory ([Matthew 17:1-9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/17.1))
- **Jairus's daughter** - only these three entered the room ([Mark 5:37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/5.37))
- **Gethsemane** - taken further into the garden ([Matthew 26:37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/26.37))

Not all were treated identically; some received more intensive preparation for future roles.

### E. Teaching Through Questions

Rather than lecture, Christ often asked:

- "Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?" followed by "But whom say ye that I am?" ([Matthew 16:13-15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/16.13))
- "Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?" ([Matthew 8:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/8.26))
- "Are you so powerless that you could not stay awake with me one hour?" ([Matthew 26:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/26.40), Greek rendering)

Questions invited self-examination more than answers would have.

## III. The Correction: How He Addressed Failure

### A. Direct Rebuke When Needed

Christ did not soften hard corrections:

**"Get thee behind me, Satan"** - To Peter, immediately after praising his confession of Christ:
- "Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men" ([Matthew 16:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/16.23))
- The same Peter who received "upon this rock I will build my church" was addressed as Satan minutes later

**"O faithless generation"** - When disciples couldn't cast out a devil:
- "O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?" ([Mark 9:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/9.19))
- He then explained privately: "Because of your unbelief" ([Matthew 17:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/17.20))

**"Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of"** - When James and John wanted to call fire on the Samaritans:
- "He turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of" ([Luke 9:55](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/9.55))

### B. Correction of Ambition

The disciples repeatedly argued about greatness:

**"Who is the greatest?"** ([Mark 9:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/9.34))
- Christ responded: "If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all" ([Mark 9:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/9.35))
- Then placed a child among them as object lesson

**James and John's request for chief seats:**
- Their mother asked that they sit at his right and left hand
- Christ redirected: "Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister; and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant" ([Matthew 20:26-27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/20.26))

### C. Correction Through Demonstration

**Foot washing** - Rather than lecture on humility:
- "If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one another's feet" ([John 13:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/13.14))
- He modeled what he expected

### D. Correction Without Rejection

Even sharp rebukes did not result in dismissal:

- Peter remained chief apostle after being called Satan
- James and John remained in the inner circle after the fire-from-heaven incident
- The Twelve continued despite "O faithless generation"

Correction was for development, not punishment.

## IV. Peter's Arc: A Case Study in Development

Peter offers the clearest window into Christ's discipleship methods:

### A. The Beginning
- Renamed from Simon to Cephas/Peter ("Rock") at first meeting ([John 1:42](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/1.42))
- Left nets immediately to follow ([Matthew 4:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/4.20))

### B. Impulsive Faith
- Walked on water, then sank: "O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?" ([Matthew 14:31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/14.31))
- Confessed Christ as Son of God: "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona" ([Matthew 16:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/16.17))
- Immediately rebuked for opposing the crucifixion: "Get thee behind me, Satan" ([Matthew 16:23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/16.23))

### C. Overconfidence
- "Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended" ([Matthew 26:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/26.33))
- Christ's response: "Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice" ([Matthew 26:34](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/26.34))

### D. The Failure
- Fell asleep in Gethsemane despite being asked to watch
- Denied Christ three times as predicted
- "Went out, and wept bitterly" ([Matthew 26:75](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/26.75))

### E. The Restoration
Christ's post-resurrection ministry to Peter was deliberate:

**Anticipatory prayer:**
- Before the denial: "I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren" ([Luke 22:32](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/22.32))
- Christ already planned for Peter's recovery and future role

**Three questions for three denials:**
- "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" - asked three times ([John 21:15-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/21.15))
- "Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me" ([John 21:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/21.17))
- The repetition allowed Peter to affirm his love as many times as he had denied it

**Commission renewed:**
- "Feed my lambs... Feed my sheep... Feed my sheep" ([John 21:15-17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/21.15))
- Failure did not disqualify him; it prepared him

---

## V. The Relationship: How He Related to Them

### A. From Servants to Friends

The relationship evolved:

- "Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you" ([John 15:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/15.15))

Friendship was based on shared knowledge, not just affection.

### B. He Prayed for Them

**John 17 - The Intercessory Prayer:**
- "I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me" ([John 17:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/17.9))
- "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil" ([John 17:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/17.15))
- "Sanctify them through thy truth" ([John 17:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/17.17))

He interceded specifically, not generally.

### C. He Cared for Their Physical Needs

- "Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat" ([Mark 6:31](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/6.31))
- After the resurrection, he cooked breakfast for them: "Come and dine" ([John 21:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/21.12))

Leadership development was not merely spiritual; he noticed when they were tired and hungry.

### D. He Bore Disappointment Without Abandonment

**Gethsemane:**
- Asked them to watch and pray; found them sleeping three times
- "What, could ye not watch with me one hour?" ([Matthew 26:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/26.40))
- Yet: "the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak" ([Matthew 26:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/26.41)) - acknowledging their limitation with compassion

**The scattering:**
- "All the disciples forsook him, and fled" ([Matthew 26:56](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/26.56))
- His first post-resurrection appearance to them: "Peace be unto you" ([John 20:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/20.19)) - not rebuke, but peace

---

## VI. The Commission: How He Sent Them Forth

### A. Authority Transferred

**During his ministry:**
- "Gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness" ([Matthew 10:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/10.1))

**After resurrection:**
- "All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and teach all nations" ([Matthew 28:18-19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/28.18))
- "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you" ([John 20:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/20.21))

**To the Nephite Twelve:**
- "I give unto you power that ye shall baptize this people when I am again ascended into heaven" ([3 Nephi 11:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.21))
- "He gave them power to give the Holy Ghost" ([3 Nephi 18:37](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18.37))

### B. The Promise of Continued Presence

- "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world" ([Matthew 28:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/28.20))
- "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you" ([John 14:18](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14.18))

Commission was not abandonment but transformation of relationship.

### C. Individual Callings

**The Nephite Twelve - asked one by one:**
- "What is it that ye desire of me, after that I am gone to the Father?" ([3 Nephi 28:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28.1))
- Nine desired to return to Christ quickly after mortal life
- Three desired to remain until Christ's return - granted differently based on their desires

He did not assign identical paths to all.

---

## VII. Successes and Failures in Apostle Development

### A. Successes

**Peter** - Denied Christ but became chief apostle, preached at Pentecost, led the early church

**John** - Remained faithful through the crucifixion, received Revelation, outlived all others

**The Eleven** - Tradition holds all but John died martyrs, never recanting

**The Nephite Twelve** - "There was not any man who had done iniquity that was not healed and raised up before them" ([3 Nephi 26:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26.15)). Their ministry bore immediate fruit.

### B. Failures

**Judas Iscariot:**
- Three years of proximity to Christ
- "Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?" ([John 6:70](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/6.70))
- Betrayed Christ for thirty pieces of silver
- Even Christ's investment did not guarantee conversion

**Slowness to understand:**
- Even after the resurrection: "Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?" ([Acts 1:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/1.6)) - still thinking politically
- Development was incomplete at his departure; the Spirit would continue the work

---

## VIII. Commonalities Across Apostle Development

### A. Selection Based on Potential, Not Achievement
None of the Twelve were qualified by conventional standards. Christ saw what they could become.

### B. Learning by Doing
They were sent before they were ready, then debriefed. Experience preceded mastery.

### C. Direct Correction Without Rejection
Rebukes were sharp but did not result in dismissal. Failure was treated as data, not disqualification.

### D. Individualized Development
Peter received different treatment than John; the inner three had different experiences than the Twelve; each Nephite disciple was asked individually about his desires.

### E. Relationship Deepened Over Time
From followers to servants to friends. Increasing disclosure matched increasing trust.

### F. Preparation for Absence
Christ explicitly prepared them to function without his physical presence:
- Taught about the Comforter
- Transferred authority
- Modeled the work they would do
- Prayed for their preservation

### G. Restoration After Failure
Peter's three affirmations for three denials; peace as the first word after their scattering. The goal was not perfection but progress.

## IX. Summary: Christ's Leadership Development Model

**Calling:**
- Chose ordinary people
- Saw potential beneath present state
- Called them to relationship first

**Training:**
- Proximity and observation
- Graduated responsibility with debriefing
- Progressive revelation matched to capacity
- Questions more than lectures

**Correction:**
- Direct and immediate when needed
- Without rejection or dismissal
- Followed by continued investment

**Relationship:**
- Evolved from servants to friends
- Personal intercession
- Attention to physical as well as spiritual needs
- Disappointment absorbed without abandonment

**Commission:**
- Authority formally transferred
- Individualized calling within collective mission
- Promise of continued presence through the Spirit

The pattern suggests leadership development is fundamentally relational, experiential, and patient - calling people to become, training through doing, correcting without discarding, and sending forth with authority while remaining present through other means.
