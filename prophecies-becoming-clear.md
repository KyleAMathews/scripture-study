# When Prophecy Becomes Clear: Understanding the Lord's Timetable for Revelation

## The Question

Throughout scripture, God, Jesus Christ, and prophets have indicated that certain prophecies and teachings will be difficult—or even impossible—to fully understand in the present moment, but will become crystal clear when the prophesied events occur or when certain spiritual conditions are met. What do the scriptures teach us about this divine pattern of progressive revelation?

## The Pattern of Sealed Prophecies

The Lord has consistently employed the practice of sealing up certain truths until their appointed time. The prophet Daniel was explicitly told to "shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end" ([Daniel 12:4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/12.4)). Later, an angel reinforced this command: "Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end" ([Daniel 12:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/12.9)). The implication is profound: some prophetic understanding is intentionally withheld until the proper season.

This same pattern appears in the Book of Mormon. Nephi prophesied that "the book shall be sealed" and that "the things which are sealed shall not be delivered in the day of the wickedness and abominations of the people" ([2 Nephi 27:7-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.7)). The sealed portion would be "kept in the book until the own due time of the Lord" ([2 Nephi 27:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27.10)).

Similarly, Moroni was commanded to seal up the record of the brother of Jared's vision, with the promise that "in that day that they shall exercise faith in me, saith the Lord...then will I manifest unto them the things which the brother of Jared saw" ([Ether 4:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/4.7)). The sealing is not permanent but conditional—awaiting both the proper time and the proper spiritual preparation.

## Understanding in the Latter Days

Multiple prophets specifically indicated that their prophecies would be understood in the last days. Nephi explained concerning Isaiah's prophecies: "In the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall know of a surety, at the times when they shall come to pass" ([2 Nephi 25:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.7)). He continued: "For in that day shall they understand them" ([2 Nephi 25:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25.8)).

Jeremiah prophesied that "in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly" ([Jeremiah 23:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/23.20)). Daniel was told his visions were "for the time of the end" ([Daniel 8:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/8.17)) and "for many days" in the future ([Daniel 10:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/10.14)).

The principle is clear: prophetic words spoken centuries or millennia ago were often intended primarily for audiences living in the last days, who would witness their fulfillment and gain perfect understanding through that witness.

## "When These Things Come to Pass, Then Shall Ye Know"

The Savior Himself taught this principle explicitly. To His apostles He said: "Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I am he" ([John 13:19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/13.19)). He repeated this pattern: "I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe" ([John 14:29](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14.29)).

The resurrected Christ taught the Nephites that "when these things come to pass that thy seed shall begin to know these things—it shall be a sign unto them" ([3 Nephi 21:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21.7)). The fulfillment of prophecy serves as both validation and illumination.

Ezekiel prophesied: "When this cometh to pass, (lo, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them" ([Ezekiel 33:33](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/33.33)). The vindication of the prophet comes not immediately, but in the day of fulfillment.

This is even built into the law given to Moses for discerning true prophets: "When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken" ([Deuteronomy 18:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/18.22)). Time and fulfillment are the ultimate tests of prophetic truth.

## Faith as the Key to Greater Light

The Lord has established a spiritual law: greater understanding comes to those who exercise faith in what they've already received. The Savior taught: "When they shall have received this, which is expedient that they should have first, to try their faith, and if it shall so be that they shall believe these things then shall the greater things be made manifest unto them" ([3 Nephi 26:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26.9)).

The Lord declared through Moroni: "Come unto me, O ye Gentiles, and I will show unto you the greater things, the knowledge which is hid up because of unbelief" ([Ether 4:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/4.13)). He promised: "When ye shall rend that veil of unbelief...then shall the great and marvelous things which have been hid up from the foundation of the world from you...be made known" ([Ether 4:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/4.15)).

Alma taught this as an eternal principle: "It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God...according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him" ([Alma 12:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.9)). Those who don't harden their hearts receive "the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full" ([Alma 12:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.10)), while those who harden their hearts receive only "the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries" ([Alma 12:11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12.11)).

## Preserved for Future Generations

Alma counseled his son Helaman that the Lord "has kept sacred, and also which he will keep and preserve for a wise purpose in him, that he may show forth his power unto future generations" ([Alma 37:14](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37.14)). Sacred records and prophecies are often intended primarily for those who come after.

Nephi saw that the Book of Mormon would be "hid up, to come forth unto the Gentiles, by the gift and power of the Lamb" ([1 Nephi 13:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13.35)) at the appointed time. He prophesied the ultimate revealing: "There is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed; there is no work of darkness save it shall be made manifest in the light; and there is nothing which is sealed upon the earth save it shall be loosed" ([2 Nephi 30:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/30.17)).

## The Promise of All Mysteries Revealed

The Lord has promised that nothing will ultimately remain hidden from the faithful. In the great vision of the degrees of glory, He declared: "To them will I reveal all mysteries, yea, all the hidden mysteries of my kingdom from days of old, and for ages to come" ([D&C 76:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.7)).

While suffering in Liberty Jail, Joseph Smith received this profound promise: "God shall give unto you knowledge by his Holy Spirit...that has not been revealed since the world was until now" ([D&C 121:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.26)). He was shown "a time to come in the which nothing shall be withheld" ([D&C 121:28](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.28)).

King Limhi taught that a seer "can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come" and that through seers, "secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known" ([Mosiah 8:17](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8.17)).

Notably, when John received the book of Revelation, he was told: "Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand" ([Revelation 22:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/22.10))—a striking contrast to Daniel's command to seal. The dispensation of the fulness of times had drawn near, and the time for unsealing had begun.

## Conclusion: The Divine Pedagogy

The pattern revealed in these scriptures reflects divine wisdom in teaching His children. Like a wise parent who gives knowledge line upon line, precept upon precept, the Lord reveals truth according to our capacity to receive it and our willingness to act upon it. Prophecies that seem obscure or improbable become luminous and undeniable when their fulfillment unfolds before our eyes.

This pattern serves multiple purposes: it tests faith in generations who must believe without seeing; it preserves sacred things from mockery by the wicked; it demonstrates God's foreknowledge when events transpire exactly as prophesied; and it provides comfort and direction to those living in the very days of fulfillment.

We live in the dispensation when many sealed things are being opened. As Daniel was told, the wise in the last days "shall understand" ([Daniel 12:10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/12.10)). Our privilege—and our responsibility—is to exercise the faith and diligence necessary to receive the greater portion of the word, watching with open eyes as ancient prophecies find their fulfillment in our day, and thereby knowing with surety that God has spoken and His servants the prophets have been among us.
